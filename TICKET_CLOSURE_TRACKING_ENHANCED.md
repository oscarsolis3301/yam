# Enhanced Ticket Closure Tracking System

## Overview

The Enhanced Ticket Closure Tracking System provides comprehensive historical data tracking for ticket closures with hourly updates, time markers, and proper time period filtering. This system addresses the issue where the Daily Ticket Closures graph was only showing today's data regardless of the selected time period.

## Key Features

### 🕒 Hourly Updates with Time Markers
- **Hourly Tracking**: Records ticket closures for each hour of the day
- **Time Markers**: Stores sync timestamps for each update
- **Historical Data**: Maintains complete history of ticket closures

### 📊 Time Period Filtering
- **Today**: Current day's ticket closures
- **Yesterday**: Previous day's ticket closures  
- **This Week**: Last 7 days aggregated
- **This Month**: Last 30 days aggregated

### 🎫 Ticket Number Tracking
- **Individual Tickets**: Stores specific ticket numbers for each closure
- **Detailed Viewing**: Click on users to see their specific ticket details
- **Historical Reference**: Access ticket information for any date

### 🗄️ Database Structure

#### New Tables

1. **`ticket_closure_history`** - Hourly tracking with time markers
   ```sql
   - id (Primary Key)
   - user_id (Foreign Key to user)
   - freshworks_user_id (Freshworks responder ID)
   - date (Date of closures)
   - hour (Hour of the day: 0-23)
   - tickets_closed (Number of tickets closed)
   - ticket_numbers (JSON string of ticket IDs)
   - sync_timestamp (When data was synced)
   - created_at, updated_at (Timestamps)
   ```

2. **`ticket_closure_daily`** - Daily aggregated data for quick access
   ```sql
   - id (Primary Key)
   - user_id (Foreign Key to user)
   - freshworks_user_id (Freshworks responder ID)
   - date (Date of closures)
   - tickets_closed (Total tickets closed for the day)
   - ticket_numbers (JSON string of all ticket IDs for the day)
   - last_sync_hour (Last hour when data was synced)
   - sync_count (Number of syncs for this day)
   - created_at, updated_at (Timestamps)
   ```

#### Legacy Support
- **`ticket_closure`** - Original table (maintained for backward compatibility)
- **`freshworks_user_mapping`** - User mappings (unchanged)
- **`ticket_sync_metadata`** - Sync tracking (enhanced)

## Installation & Setup

### 1. Initialize the System

Run the initialization script to create the new database tables:

```bash
python scripts/init_ticket_closure_tracking.py
```

This script will:
- Create new database tables
- Sync user mappings from `IDs.txt`
- Link users to Freshworks mappings
- Initialize today's and yesterday's data
- Show database statistics

### 2. Database Location

The database file is located at:
```
app/db/ticket_closure_tracking.db
```

This is easily findable and separate from the main application database.

### 3. Automated Hourly Sync

Set up automated hourly sync using cron:

```bash
# Add to crontab (run every hour during business hours)
0 8-18 * * * cd /path/to/yam && python scripts/hourly_ticket_sync.py --once >> logs/ticket_sync.log 2>&1

# Or run every hour all day
0 * * * * cd /path/to/yam && python scripts/hourly_ticket_sync.py --once >> logs/ticket_sync.log 2>&1
```

## Usage

### YAM Dashboard

   - Go to the Daily Ticket Closures section

2. **Time Period Filtering**
   - Click "Today" for current day's data
   - Click "This Week" for last 7 days
   - Click "This Month" for last 30 days
   - **NEW**: Click "Yesterday" for previous day's data

3. **View Ticket Details**
   - Click on any user's bar in the chart
   - View detailed ticket information including ticket numbers
   - See historical data for any date

### API Endpoints

#### Enhanced Period Filtering

GET /api/tickets/closures/period?period=today
GET /api/tickets/closures/period?period=yesterday
GET /api/tickets/closures/period?period=week
GET /api/tickets/closures/period?period=month
```

#### Hourly Sync (Admin Only)
```http

## Technical Implementation

### Service Architecture

#### `TicketClosureService`
- **Location**: `app/utils/ticket_closure_service.py`
- **Purpose**: Main service for ticket closure tracking
- **Features**:
  - Hourly sync with historical tracking
  - Time period filtering
  - Daily aggregation
  - User ticket details

#### Enhanced API Routes
- **Location**: `app/blueprints/tickets_api/routes.py`
- **Updates**:
  - Period filtering now uses enhanced service
  - User details use new service
  - Added hourly sync endpoint

#### JavaScript Enhancements
- **Location**: `app/templates/components/yam/yam_user_tickets_scripts.html`
- **Updates**:
  - Proper time period filtering
  - Event listeners for time control buttons
  - Enhanced data fetching and caching

### Database Models

#### New Models
```python
# app/models/base.py
class TicketClosureHistory(db.Model):
    """Hourly tracking with time markers"""

class TicketClosureDaily(db.Model):
    """Daily aggregated data for quick access"""
```

## Migration from Legacy System

### Automatic Migration
The initialization script includes an option to migrate existing data:

```bash
python scripts/init_ticket_closure_tracking.py
# Choose 'y' when prompted to migrate existing data
```

### Manual Migration
If you need to migrate data manually:

```python
from app.utils.ticket_closure_service import ticket_closure_service

# Migrate existing data
ticket_closure_service.migrate_existing_data()
```

## Monitoring & Maintenance

### Database Statistics
View current database statistics:

```python
from app.utils.ticket_closure_service import ticket_closure_service

stats = ticket_closure_service.get_database_stats()
print(stats)
```

### Log Files
Monitor sync activity in:
- `app.log` - Application logs
- `logs/ticket_sync.log` - Sync-specific logs (if using cron)

### Health Checks
The system includes built-in health checks:
- Chart stability monitoring
- Data validation
- Automatic recovery mechanisms

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **No Data Showing for Yesterday/Week/Month**
   - Ensure hourly sync is running
   - Check if data exists in `ticket_closure_daily` table
   - Verify user mappings are correct

2. **Time Period Filtering Not Working**
   - Clear browser cache
   - Check JavaScript console for errors
   - Verify API endpoints are responding

3. **Hourly Sync Failing**
   - Check Freshworks API credentials
   - Verify network connectivity
   - Review error logs

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Test hourly sync
python scripts/hourly_ticket_sync.py --once

# Check database statistics
python -c "
from app import create_app
from app.utils.ticket_closure_service import ticket_closure_service
app = create_app()
with app.app_context():
    stats = ticket_closure_service.get_database_stats()
    print(stats)
"

# Test time period filtering
curl "http://localhost:5000/api/tickets/closures/period?period=yesterday"
```
