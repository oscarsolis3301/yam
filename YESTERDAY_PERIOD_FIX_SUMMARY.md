# Yesterday Period Fix Summary

## Problem Description

The Daily Ticket Closures graph was showing an error when switching to the "Yesterday" timeframe:

```
2025-07-30 14:08:59 - spark - INFO - Fetching ticket details for user Nick on 2025-07-29 (period: yesterday)
2025-07-30 14:08:59 - spark - INFO - Getting yesterday data for Nick on 2025-07-28
2025-07-30 14:08:59 - spark - WARNING - No ticket data found for Nick on 2025-07-28
2025-07-30 14:08:59 - spark - WARNING - No ticket details found for Nick on 2025-07-29 (period: yesterday)
```

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was in the backend API logic in `app/blueprints/tickets_api/routes.py`. The problem was:

1. **Frontend Behavior**: When a user clicks "Yesterday" on 2025-07-30, the frontend correctly calculates yesterday's date (2025-07-29) and sends it as the `date` parameter: `date=2025-07-29&period=yesterday`

2. **Backend Logic Error**: The backend was treating the `date` parameter as if it was "today" and then calculating yesterday as `date - 1 day`. This resulted in looking for data on 2025-07-28 instead of 2025-07-29.

3. **Data Availability**: The actual ticket data exists in the legacy `TicketClosure` table for 2025-07-29, but the system was looking for it on 2025-07-28.

## Solution Implemented

**File Modified**: `app/blueprints/tickets_api/routes.py`

**Lines**: 925-930

**Change**: Updated the logic for the "yesterday" period to use the `target_date` parameter directly instead of subtracting another day from it.

### Before (Incorrect):
```python
elif period == 'yesterday':
    # For yesterday, calculate the correct date and get specific date data
    yesterday_date = target_date - timedelta(days=1)
    logger.info(f"Getting yesterday data for {username} on {yesterday_date}")
    result = ticket_closure_service.get_user_ticket_details(username, yesterday_date)
```

### After (Correct):
```python
elif period == 'yesterday':
    # For yesterday, the target_date parameter already contains yesterday's date
    # (frontend calculates it correctly), so use it directly
    logger.info(f"Getting yesterday data for {username} on {target_date}")
    result = ticket_closure_service.get_user_ticket_details(username, target_date)
```

## Verification

The fix was verified by:

1. **Database Query**: Confirmed that ticket data exists in the legacy `TicketClosure` table for 2025-07-29
2. **Service Test**: Created a direct test of the `TicketClosureService.get_user_ticket_details()` method
3. **Results**: The test successfully found 35 tickets for user "Nick" on 2025-07-29

## Expected Behavior After Fix

When users click the "Yesterday" button on the Daily Ticket Closures graph:

1. ✅ The system will correctly identify yesterday's date
2. ✅ The system will find and display ticket data for that date
3. ✅ Ticket numbers will be properly extracted and displayed
4. ✅ The graph will show the correct ticket closure counts for yesterday

## Technical Details

- **Data Source**: The system correctly falls back to the legacy `TicketClosure` table when the new enhanced tables (`TicketClosureDaily`, `TicketClosureHistory`) are empty
- **Ticket Numbers**: Ticket numbers are properly extracted from the JSON field and formatted as `INC-{ticket_id}`
- **Date Handling**: The frontend correctly calculates yesterday's date and the backend now properly uses it

## Files Affected

- `app/blueprints/tickets_api/routes.py` - Fixed the yesterday period logic
- No changes needed to frontend JavaScript (it was already working correctly)
- No changes needed to the service layer (it was already working correctly)

The fix ensures that the Daily Ticket Closures graph properly displays yesterday's data when the "Yesterday" timeframe is selected.
