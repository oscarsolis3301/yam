# Team Member Integration with Daily Ticket Closures

This document explains the complete integration between team members from the Freshworks system and the YAM application's user accounts.

## Overview

The system now automatically creates user accounts for team members found in the Daily Ticket Closures database, ensuring that all team members have access to the YAM application and their ticket closure data is properly linked.

## Components

### 1. Freshworks Team Members Source
- **File**: `app/Freshworks/IDs.txt`
- **Format**: `Name - Freshworks_ID`
- **Example**: `Oscar Solis - 18014125885`

### 2. Database Models
- **FreshworksUserMapping**: Maps Freshworks user IDs to local users
- **TicketClosure**: Tracks daily ticket closures by user
- **User**: Standard user accounts with authentication

### 3. Integration Scripts

#### `app/reset_db.py` (Enhanced)
- Loads team members from `Freshworks/IDs.txt`
- Creates user accounts for all team members
- Creates Freshworks user mappings
- Sets default password: `password`

#### `scripts/create_users_from_ticket_closures.py`
- Standalone script for creating user accounts
- Syncs Freshworks mappings from IDs.txt
- Creates missing user accounts
- Provides detailed status reporting

#### `app/utils/database.py` (Enhanced)
- `sync_freshworks_team_members()`: Syncs team members on startup
- `create_users_from_ticket_closures()`: Creates users from mappings
- Integrated into database initialization

### 4. Admin Interface

#### Team Members Management Page
- **URL**: `/admin/team-members`
- **Features**:
  - View all team members from Freshworks
  - See which users have accounts
  - Create missing user accounts
  - Sync Freshworks mappings
  - Statistics dashboard

#### API Endpoints
- `GET /admin/api/team-members/status` - Get team member status
- `POST /admin/api/team-members/sync` - Sync team members
- `POST /admin/api/team-members/create-missing` - Create missing users

## How It Works

### 1. Database Reset Process
When `reset_db.py` is run:
1. Loads team members from `Freshworks/IDs.txt`
2. Creates user accounts for each team member
3. Creates Freshworks user mappings
4. Sets default passwords

### 2. Daily Ticket Closures Integration
- Team members appear in the YAM Dashboard Daily Ticket Closures chart
- Their ticket closure data is automatically linked to their user accounts
- Real-time updates from Freshworks API

### 3. User Authentication
- Team members can log in with their full name as username
- Default password: `password`
- Should change password on first login

1. **Oscar Solis** - 18014125885

## Usage Instructions

### For Administrators

#### 1. Reset Database with Team Members
```bash
python app/reset_db.py
```
This will create user accounts for all team members automatically.

#### 2. Create Missing Users Only
```bash
python scripts/create_users_from_ticket_closures.py
```
This will only create accounts for team members who don't have them yet.

#### 3. Admin Interface
1. Navigate to `/admin/team-members`
2. View team member status
3. Use "Sync Team Members" to update mappings
4. Use "Create Missing Users" to add new accounts

### For Team Members

#### 1. First Login
- **Username**: Your full name (e.g., "Oscar Solis")
- **Password**: `password`
- **Action**: Change password immediately

#### 2. Access Daily Ticket Closures

## Technical Details

### Database Schema
```sql
-- Freshworks user mappings
CREATE TABLE freshworks_user_mapping (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INTEGER REFERENCES user(id),
    freshworks_user_id INTEGER UNIQUE,
    freshworks_username VARCHAR(100),
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP
);

-- Ticket closures
CREATE TABLE ticket_closure (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INTEGER REFERENCES user(id),
    freshworks_user_id INTEGER,
    date DATE,
    tickets_closed INTEGER,
    ticket_numbers TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP,
    UNIQUE(user_id, date)
);
```

### File Structure
```

├── Freshworks/
│   └── IDs.txt                    # Team member source
├── models/
│   └── base.py                    # Database models

└── reset_db.py                    # Enhanced database reset

scripts/
└── create_users_from_ticket_closures.py  # Standalone script
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Duplicate Email Error
- **Cause**: User already exists with same email
- **Solution**: Script automatically skips existing users

#### 2. Missing Freshworks Mappings
- **Cause**: IDs.txt not found or corrupted
- **Solution**: Check file path and format

#### 3. Database Connection Issues
- **Cause**: Database locked or connection failed
- **Solution**: Ensure no other processes are using the database

### Debugging

#### Check Team Member Status
```bash
python scripts/create_users_from_ticket_closures.py
```

#### Verify Database State
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM user;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM freshworks_user_mapping;
SELECT username, email FROM user WHERE role = 'user';
```

#### Check Admin Interface
Navigate to `/admin/team-members` to view detailed status.

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Automatic Password Reset**: Force password change on first login
2. **Role Assignment**: Assign different roles based on Freshworks data
3. **Profile Pictures**: Auto-assign profile pictures based on names
4. **Email Notifications**: Notify new users when accounts are created
5. **Bulk Operations**: Admin interface for bulk user management

### Integration Opportunities
1. **Active Directory**: Sync with Windows domain users
2. **SSO Integration**: Single sign-on with Freshworks
3. **API Webhooks**: Real-time user creation from Freshworks
4. **Audit Logging**: Track user creation and changes

## Conclusion

This integration provides a seamless experience for team members to access the YAM application while maintaining their ticket closure data. The automated account creation ensures all team members have access without manual intervention, and the admin interface provides full visibility and control over the process.
