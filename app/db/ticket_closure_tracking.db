-- Ticket Closure Tracking Database
-- This database stores historical ticket closure data with hourly updates and time markers
-- Created: 2025-01-29
-- Purpose: Track daily ticket closures by user with historical data for time period filtering

-- This is a placeholder file. The actual database will be created by SQLAlchemy models.
-- The database file will be located at: app/db/ticket_closure_tracking.db

-- Tables that will be created:
-- 1. ticket_closure_history - Hourly tracking with time markers
-- 2. ticket_closure_daily - Daily aggregated data for quick access
-- 3. ticket_closure - Legacy table (maintained for backward compatibility)
-- 4. freshworks_user_mapping - User mappings
-- 5. ticket_sync_metadata - Sync tracking

-- The database will be automatically initialized when the application starts.
