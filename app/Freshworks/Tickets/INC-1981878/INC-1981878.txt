## Description

Upon checking previous user incorrectly moved that payment to duplicate review as it was posted twice under the same check# 107590101 and we received response as "As per EOB review both payment received same patient and same month (8/1/2022, 8/2/2022). Payment distributed to DOS 8/1/2022 invoice# A068Z616520 now Claim is posted correctly, as per EOB". So checked paper EOB and found both the payment of $101.20 are paid for the same month (8/1/2022, 8/2/2022), for the same patient and for the same provider under the same check#107590101 but we have different claim# 202209217130872 &amp; 202209217145323, so this need to be validated. So as there is no Wq available, created a trace ticket# to validate why ins paid twice for the same month.
