Hi Rayleen,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1987356.

On review FA# 871814884 #871784187 for plan Blue Cross Blue Shield of TX PPO / Dnoa PPO attached as Primary coverage and fees link not attached showing only dashes . Verified EPIC Plan Reimbursement Page found fees contract for plan Dnoa PPO termed on 07/23/2025 and not yet started for DOS 08/04/2025. So please manually override with the FS available in Fee finder. Hence Routing to Nicole Oliveri For Further Review. Thank You
