Hi Piruntha,

Thanks for reaching out, after reviewing the OS provider was in network for DOS 07/18/25. The codes in question originally populated correctly after FA review, found overrides by office for D7210. D0140 is non-covered more than once in a 12 month period per EOB review. Additionally, D7210 paid out correctly based on benefits attached to DE form. 233-75 DED=158 x 10% = 15.80 insurance expect. Advise office to update FA to align with the EOB since fees populated correctly originally. 

If you have any other questions or concerns please let us know.
