Hi Carin Hendricks,,,


The patient does not have a credit of $606. Once the credit is transferred, the patient will have a self-pay balance. Could you please confirm whether the transfer should proceed? If confirmed, kindly open a ticket once completed. Please note that this request requires RM/RD submission—have the office's RD or RM submit the request for the transfer to be approvedThank you,
