Hi Infant,


On review FA#815798356 found plan Unitedhealth Group PPO - Dental / First Dental Health PPO attached as primary coverage for the DOS 05/19/2025 code D4341 was populating correctly. Verified EOB found the code D4341 LL was allowed less than the expected amount and code D4341 UL has been denied with reason code APL Deep cleaning is denied. Records do not show gum disease evident bydeep gum measurements, bone loss on x-rays, and tissue loss. Upon reviewing the allowed amount matching with Dental Benefit Providers PPO for the code D4341. Hence routing this ticket to eligibility team for plan verification. Thank youPlease find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1982121.
