## Description

Spoke with insurance Rep Aisha from Aetna ppo, it looks like the office charged out Start codes on 7/17/23 for orthodontic treatment and the patient never started treatment. Insurance paid $958.50 on 8/17/2023 that needs to be refunded to the insurance so that patient has their orthodontic maximum back, if you can please help with this. Thank you!Â

Hi Tony,

Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1986472.

Thank you for your ticket request. We have reviewed the patient account per your request. Per our review, the patient banded on 07/17/2023 for 12M. As per checking they charge out start code on 07/17/2023 later they voided. Based on that info they billed claim to ins and Ins paid for banding. So. Requesting office to confirm whether the pt banded on 07/17/2023 or not. If it yes please charge out start code on 07/17/2023. Once info is provided, we will adjust the account accordingly.

Thank you,
Have a great day!
