## Description


Hi there, 




I am reaching out to assist this team member, she has mentioned that she will be planning to shift into part time and get a second job at Starbucks to help her with college tuition. I am generally curious on how the waitlist works and how long the average amount
 of time for someone to expect would be? 




I appreciate any help or info you can provide,

Hi Heather,



I’m so glad you have team members interested in this benefit!  We have a set budget each year to fund this benefit, and depending on what degree program people choose and depending on how many credits they have left to graduate,
 dictates how many people we have in the program without going over budget.  We continue to get approval to increase this budget each year which further expands the number of people who can participate. 



With that said, most people who are on the wait list, are on there for less than a year - most of the time, for about 6 months. 



If you don’t want your team member to wait that long, you can always connect with your RP and identify if there is tuition reimbursement budget available in your region.  If so, your team member can start through that program, and
 then transfer to the CAP program when it’s their turn to cone off the wait list. 



I hope that is helpful.

Good evening, Trish! 




I was hoping you can provide information for me to relay to my teams. I have a team member that received an email informing her that shes on the waitlist for ASU enrollment through the college advancement program. 




What I would like clarification on; Is there a CAP on how many team members we can have sign up? Ive been given both yes and no answer but according to this ticket response we do, correct? 

Is there anything specific I can relay to the team members asking when this occurs? 




Thank you in advance for your support! Have a great week!

Hi Victoria Mata,

Your ticket has been
Closed.
Closure Comments: Hi Victoria, Thanks for reaching out and for your interest in the CAP program! Unfortunately, we do not currently have a release date scheduled for our next group. We did recently pull a group off of the waitlist in February 2024 but
 do not have our next release date scheduled yet. Keep an eye on your email as this is how you will be contacted once you are up next. If you are uncomfortable with the wait, we encourage you to also look into the Tuition Reimbursement Program that PDS offers.
 I have attached the Tuition Reimbursement policy and request form, if you would like to look into this program and take advantage of it while you remain on the College Advancement Program waitlist. Approval for the Tuition Reimbursement Program is required
 by your RP. I hope this information is helpful. Please let me know if you have any questions. Thank you, Haydee
