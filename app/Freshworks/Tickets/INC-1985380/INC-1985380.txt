Hi sarah.henderson,

There
was a temp fee outage during DOS. Fees have since been verified in epic and now
populating as of this morning.

There
is a gap in the reimbursement contract from 07/27/2025 to 07/30/2025 . The
office will need to manually coordinate PT fees for any DOS in this time fame using the fee finder link below.

Thank
You.

On review FA# 874224132 for the DOS 07/30/2025 plan Deltacare HMO - Dental / C84 attached as primary coverage and fees are showing dashes in FA and some codes are overridden. Verified DE form found same plan is attached . Verified Epic Reimbursement page  found fees contract termed on 07/27/2025 and not yet started.  So please manually override with the FS attached here.. Hence routing to Jocelyn Scott for further review
