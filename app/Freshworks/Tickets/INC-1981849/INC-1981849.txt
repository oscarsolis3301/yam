Hi Swarnapriya Sivakumar

Thank you for reaching out to Patient Benefits. 

We have completed and updated the DE form to reflect the most current benefit information.


Unfortunately, the patient has maxed out their dental benefits and would not be eligible for services until the next benefit period.



Kindly,
Patient Benefits Service Desk

Hi Swarnapriya,


On review FA#862844426 the plan  Cigna PPO - Dental / UCR as priamry coverage for DOS 07/16/2025 code D2740 was populating correctly. Checked in DE form the benefits are matching with EOB for the code D2740. In EOB the code D2740 was allowed less and the allowed amount is matching with Cigna PPO fee schedule. Checked in CG the provider is active for the DOS hence routing this ticket to eligibility team for plan reverification.
