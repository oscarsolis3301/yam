## Description

PT PAID $200 CASH AND $348 ON A VISA FOR TX ON 7-19-25. PT DID NOT DO TREATMENT AND I SUBMITTED A REFUND REQUEST FOR THE VISA AND FOR A CHECK TO BE SENT TO PATIENT DUE TO CASH WAS IN SAFE SO I COULD NOT REFUND PATIENT CASH.  IT LOOKS AS THOUGH THE CASH PAYMENT WAS REMOVED FROM THE SYSTEM, BUT THE PATIENT WAS NEVER REFUNDED.  I AM ATTACHING SCREEN SHOTS OF THE RECEIPT FROM THE SAFE AND EPIC AND THE REFUND REQUEST.  PATIENT IS VERY UPSET THAT THEY HAVE NOT RECIEVED THE $200 REFUND AS THE ORIGINAL PAYMENT WAS REVERSED. PLEASE RE-ENTER PAYMENT SO THAT REFUND CAN BE SENT TO PATIENT. THANK YOU.

Hi Susan,

I hope this email finds you well.

The $200.00 cash payment previously voided in error has been posted to the patient’s Epic account, so your office can proceed with processing a refund to the patient.

Thank you! Please let us know if you need any further assistance.

Best regards,Stephanie Henry
