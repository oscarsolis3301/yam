Hi Lara,

Refund request of $23 has been requested in EPIC and will now be completed by the accounting/refunds team. I have also distributed the $74 payment on invoice A72910374350 for the D4910. Ticket closed. Have a great day!Â Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1983135.
