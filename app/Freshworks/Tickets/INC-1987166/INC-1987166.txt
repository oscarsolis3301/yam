Guarantor id# 800636856, qsi id# 8010070,Per review found primary ins paid $1486.50 ($77.00 for records + $1409.50 for banding) from dos 3/22 to 10/23 &amp; denied as 'benefit max has been reached'. Primary unpaid balance is $13.50.Previously trace ticket (#INC-1781393) has been raised as pat has met the ortho max of $1500.00 out of $2500.00 &amp; they took the claim for reprocess by adding the info and took the claim back for reprocessing. Then received reprocessed response (#INC-1836627)as: 'Rep stated since the claim is still in open status rep going to add the additional info again such as the arch as upper and lower arch ,the total months in treatment is 24 months, the total case fee is $8120.00 and mentioning this as a comprehensive treatment and sent the claim back for reprocess and expetised it'. Recently we received the call response for reprocessed claim (#INC-1862551) on May 28 2025 as: 'spoke with ANN and verified the previous ticket status on 05/01/2025 as claim was sent for reprocess as provided the arch as upper and lower arch and the total months in treatment is 24 months. As they received the information the rep took the claim back for reprocessing and rep ANN verified and stated that previous reprocess was sent and on 05/16/2025 they received update from adjuster team as they have not received the info as Upper and lower arch and the total amount as $8120.00, and ANN made a not on that and sent the information to the adjuster team, TAT 5 business days'. again created ics trace ticket #1942750 to follow up with ins for the reprocess status of the claims from dos 11/23.stated the ticket was under Processing and the processor confirmed that reason for the arch and length of the treatment on 06/11/2025 and it was under review but still they didn't received any update and so Rep sent the claim for Reprocessing and she stated she will send it for escalation to process the claim quickly. TAT- 15 bus days later on received response as Unable to verify both Cigna and Mutual of Omaha payments on web due to age ,Appears we have multiple payment posted under wrong insurance carrier ,since there is clear information the reprocess status and received info which is contradictory , Hence raised ICS trace tkt# to know the claim status and deferred for 14 days ,Once received response we can work further
