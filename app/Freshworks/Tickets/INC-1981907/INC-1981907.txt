On review found fees populating correctly for code D7210 in FA#852325441. Benefits updated after record was finalized. Replace to update amounts. Patient has primary coverage Metlife PPO - Dental / Metlife Pdp same fees link attached. Verified dental eligibility found plan METLIFE PPO [670], METLIFE PDP with status Verified by Auto Eligibility.  When we review the EOB for code D7210 claim processed with correct allowed amount as per estimate but paid 80% by insurance with 20% patient responsibility and also applied 50.00 deductible. As per DE form for code D7210 benefit 50% insurance responsibility and 50% patient responsibility. Verified Credentialing status found Billing Provider status is active for DOS. Hence routed to Eligibility for benefit re-verification. Please let me know for any additional questions, Thank you
