## Description

AS per review found that insurance banding is on 7/2024 along with 24 months treatment, per review it’s a unbilled case so we need to work for the ppo credit calculator and the reimbursement calculator. Per review its found that for working with the calc, the co-pay document checked Fee Finder found a document for member copayment and then checked Document finder found some GP and SP docs however in those docs no AA found to work using PPO Calcs. So need insurance contracted rate D8080,D9310,D9450,D0330,D03450,D0350,D0470,D8670,D8680 required ortho codes. A previous user is already created Trace ticket and we gets a response as rep about the allowed amt for all ortho codes. For the codes,D8080 Allowed amt $2911.00, paid amt $91.00, PR $2820.00 ,D8670 Allowed amt $83.00, paid amt $83.00, PR $0.00,D9310 not billed in claim form,D9450 Allowed amt $0.00, is not covered based on patient plan,D0330, D0340, D0350, D0470, D9450 - Allowed amt $1088.00, paid amt $0.00, copay $1088.00 - denied as provider is OON and the provider don't have OON benefits.D8680 not billed in claim form, Call ref# 2000461516576. As per this ticket response we gets a bulk amount for the codes D0330, D0340,D0350,D0470 as $1088, so we need to know about this payment, is this payment amount is correct or not and for make it clarification we need to route this to ICS inquiry, after getting a proper response we can work for it.hence, we don’t have any audit work que to move to ICS , so we need to create a Trace Ticket number   and after getting a proper response we can work for it .And need to defer the undistributed work ques for 14 days. De band code not yet charged.
