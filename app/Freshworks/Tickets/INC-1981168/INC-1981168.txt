## Description


Dear Credentialing team, 
I have reviewed the attached document titled “Addendum to Participation Agreement for Medicare Advantage Plans,” which includes the following clauses:

19. Participating Dentist may terminate this Addendum without cause and without terminating the Agreement (and your participation in Delta Dental’s other networks) upon sixty (60) days’ prior written notice to
 Delta Dental by following the notice requirements in the Participation Agreement. Your notice of termination will only be effective for the networks or programs specified in your notice.


20. This Addendum may be terminated immediately by Delta Dental if Participating Dentist is: (a) excluded from participation in Medicare; (b) placed on the Preclusion List; (c) opts-out of Medicare by filing an
 affidavit under Section 1802(b) of the Social Security Act; or (d) elects to terminate his/her status as a participating dentist in the MA Plans.

It appears that clause 19 introduces a 60-day notice requirement, which seems to differ from the terms outlined in my employment contract. Could you kindly provide additional clarification or context regarding this?
 
Best, 
Tima Yarmand, DDS
