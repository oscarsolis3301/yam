Hi Ronnie,

Actually, the Patient Payments department does not perform this function.  I will forward your request to Credits and Refunds.

Thank you.

Are you able to transfer this payment to our office from 769?? It will not allow me to do it, and I need it transferred so I can update payment arrangement.

Hi Ronnie,

You're correct; there is no Smartpay arrangement set up under guarantor ID #12737719.  The $245.42 was processed in office as a "Same Day Services" gurantor payment.  Please refer to the previous email regarding submitting a Help Ticket to ROC Credits and Refunds to request the payment transfer.


Thank you,

Best regards,

Ok, that may have been a glitch in the system I am assuming b/c pt does not have any smart pay arrangements set up with 769. How do we get that allocated properly?

Hi Ronnie,

I hope you're doing well.

Upon reviewing Joseph Groneman's account, we identified two guarantor accounts: ID #12737719 (Office 769 Cincinnati 2) and #12879700 (Office 1153 Cincinnati 6). The $245.42 payment made on July 9, 2025, was posted under guarantor ID #12737719, Office 769.

To correct this, please submit a Help Ticket to ROC Credits and Refunds requesting the transfer of this payment from Office 769 to Office 1153.

Thank you. Please let us know if you need further assistance.

Best regards,
Stephanie Henry
