Hi Dominique,

This
subscriber is Federal Employee and has the Federal Medical Plan with a dental
rider attached. per coverage tab the payor address is listed as TX. This
ins is always billed first (even though there's no expect). and secondary is listed as BCBS MN and paid for DOS 06/30/2025. EOB is scanned to invoice. however the coverage tab reflects records 2 and 3 are duplicates as sub id# and group# are the same but for different plans.Â
