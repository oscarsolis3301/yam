Corrected Notes;

On review FA #873399768 found plan Delta Dental of MN PPO - Dental / Delta Preferred as primary coverage and fees are populating correctly as per FA for code D3330.  Verified DE form found plan  DELTA DENTAL OF MN PPO [448], DELTA PREFERRED with status Completed - ROC. Verified Epic EOB found for code D3330 allowed amount not matching with FA found reason code #131: Claim specific negotiated discount. Verified CyberArk unable to pull the paper. As per credentialing grid billing provider status active for DOS. Hence routed to eligibility to re-verify.

Thank you!
