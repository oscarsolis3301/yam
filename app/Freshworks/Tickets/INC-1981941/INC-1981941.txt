## Description

insurance paid $ 100.00 for records and no banding payment is received as there is no expect . As the insurance overpaid need to check the credit calculator but there is no fee schedule document and also there is no UCR fees to calculate this. Hence previously created trace ticket # 1940149 and received response as allowed amount D0330-$100.00 and D0350 and D8680- Not covered by the plan and D0340-D0470- The claims are not Â paid as this policy will pay $100.00 for the every 150 days and no other info was provided by the Rep. As there is no proper response and no allowed amount to do the credit calculator again raised an ICS trace ticket# requesting an fee schedule document for the insurance. Once response received will work accordingly .
