## Description

I set up my new Okta for PDS Health and am now missing all of the apps I previously had in my old Okta, include Specialty Connect, which is a newly released product I am responsible for. These items are not just "boomarks" as outlined in the guide, but are actual PDS systems (Add Provider, Remove Provider, People Services, Recruitment Center, etc) that did not transition over.

Hi Joshua,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1986343.

Thank you for reaching out!

If your PDS Health Okta dashboard looks empty right now—no need to worry. This is expected during our transition to the new PDS Health Okta tenant.

As noted in our communications, when you first log in at https://pdshealth.okta.com, your application tiles may not appear right away. This is a normal part of the migration process. In the meantime, you can continue using the previous Okta dashboard at https://pacificdental.okta.com.

Here are a few helpful reminders:

Your credentials (username and password) haven’t changed.
Be sure you've completed registration and MFA setup in the new tenant.
Personal bookmarks from your old dashboard won't transfer automatically. You’ll need to recreate them—see the attached guide for help.


If you still don’t see your expected applications after August 1st, feel free to open a ticket HERE and we’ll take a closer look.

Thank you for your patience as we complete the transition!



If any questions please let me know.

Thanks, 


Vinh
