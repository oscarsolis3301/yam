Hi Rosalie,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1985609.

Please be informed that submitting a ticket would be advisable for fees related issues but before that please try replacing the FA or recreate the FA and make sure that the plan attached is correct. Hence resolving this ticket. 

Thank you

Hi,

Perfect thanks so much for your help, will I have to place a ticket every time we see this in office? And is there anything we can do to streamline to have this not happen in Epic? I am just trying to find what the fix would be at the office level. 





Best,

Hi Rosalie,

for the MRN provided: 25956408 there are no dashes on the FA and patient has Principal Financial. As well, the screenshots attached of the FAs do not have dashes and the FAs have the same UCR/FEES/PT Portion, can you clarify where you're seeing these dashes? 

both FAs attached to the ticket have identical sums. no dashes:
