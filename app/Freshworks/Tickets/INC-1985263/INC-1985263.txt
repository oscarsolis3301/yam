Hi Linda,
Our bug fix was implemented and it resolved these Prod Days for your providers.  Here is a screenshot for Dr Johnson to verify:

Hi Sam,




So when I opened the day on 7/26 I did not follow the first step to say add exceptions and comment field we serve. When I noticed Monday it hit prism I did some digging and realized I messed up the first part. They are all attached to we serve guarantor but
 the snap board allocating a day worked. When I went in to follow the steps correctly the date for 7/26 is greyed out. Can you please help me so we can get this resolved before month end.

Hi Linda,
This is Sam with the reporting team, I hope your week is going well.  I think this issue may be a bug on our end, we are investigating. 


Here are general notes on We Serve Days: 
For a day to count as a ‘We Serve’ day and not count in the production day count, all scheduled accounts have to be a ‘We Serve’ account and also there has to be at least 1 charge by the scheduled provider.
