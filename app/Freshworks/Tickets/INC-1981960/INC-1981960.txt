Hi Sachin,

On review FA#858483749 the plan Unitedhealth Group PPO - Dental / Dental Benefit Providers PPO as primary coverage for DOS 07/15/2025 code D3320 was populating correctly. Checked in De form the benefits are matching with EOB for the code D3320, in EOB the code D3320 was allowed less with remark code PSC - The charge exceeds the allowable amount for this procedure. Checked in CG the billing provider is not listed so will be consider as OON hence resolving this ticket and please reach out to insurance for further review. Thank you
