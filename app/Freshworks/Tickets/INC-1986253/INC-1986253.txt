Hi Cherrie,

I was able to locate the amount on the Daily Deposit. 
Due to the amount being transferred, you would need to filter the Transaction Status to "Actives and Reversals"This showed the HFD Transaction on 7/30

Hi Cherrie,

I have reached out to my supervisor to get further information as to why this is not showing up on the daily deposit report.
Placing ticket on hold until we get an answer.
