## Description

hello please see attached to this ticket letter from Delta Dental of Oregon &amp; Alaska advising that provider is not credentialed as of 06/04/2025. I did locate old help ticket#1724788 created
by office that contains ODS application and credentialing application for
Oregon providers with closed notes: "application has been sent to payer on 01/22/2025. Credentialing is currently taking 90 days to
process. will follow up on that" can you please provide current up to date status, i have called ODS today and was advised that as of today the provider is still not showing credentialed. rep advised for up to date questions for this provider being credentialed that we email credentialing@modahealth.com. I would like to request this to be an escalated request if possible. We have about 60 claims for this provider that are on hold. we are getting close to getting hit with timely filing on some of them. Thank you so much for your help and time
