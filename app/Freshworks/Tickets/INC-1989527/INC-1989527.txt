## Description

Â As per account review INS paid from banding till 07/25 including initial and deband records, Since INS over paid we need to check HMO credit calculator but per review INS paid for deband record payment of $529.00 under check # 202412230002945 which was already absorbed towards provider by taking ROC Inclusive ADJ but later the same payment was recouped by INS under check # 202502250002132 , Therefore we need to check with INS why this payment was recouped , Once we get response from ICS team then will perform the credits calculator,
