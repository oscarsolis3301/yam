Hi Bavithra,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1984825.



On review found fees populating correctly for code D4341 in FA#826778973. Patient has Primary coverage Equitable PPO - Dental / Advantage Plus fees link attached United Concordia - Advantage Plus - Advantage Plus SoCal Reg 19. Verified dental eligibility found EQUITABLE PPO [2022], ADVANTAGE PLUS with status ROC Request Pending. When we review the EOB claim not processed based on the Advantage Plus fees allowed amount with no specific reason code. As per credentialing grid billing provider status is INN with UCCI Advantage Plus PPO and Equitable PPO not in grid. Hence routed to eligibility to re-verify the eligibility and attach the correct plan to patient coverage &amp; FA. Please let me know for any additional questions. Thank You
