Hi Lorenzo,

I hope you're doing well.

The July 29, 2025, change request to add an additional treatment amount of $881.60 was processed on July 30, 2025. The unsecured status in Epic has been removed, as the system has now been updated. 

However, there is still a discrepancy: the SmartPay arrangement balance is $2,406.60, while the Epic balance is $2,337.60—a difference of $69.00. You may want to verify that all charges are accurately reflected in Epic.

Please let us know if you need further assistance.

Thank you,
Best regardsStephanie Henry
