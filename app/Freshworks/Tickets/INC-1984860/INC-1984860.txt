Hi Ramakrishna,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1984860.

On review FA#862576199 found plan Guardian / Dentalguard Preferred attached as primary coverage and verified DE form found same plan is attached. Code D2740 alternate provision is applied in FA. Verified EOB found insurances paid less than estimate. Verified credentialling found billing provider is INN with plan Guardian . So please verify the plan and Once verification is completed please route back to ROC FEES to further Review. thank you
