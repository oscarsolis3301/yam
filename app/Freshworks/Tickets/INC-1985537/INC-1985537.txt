## Description

Hello, the FO team accidentally clicked "check" for payment, but pt paid with a credit card. I just found out that if incorrect payment is selected for cash/check, we should "void" in guarantor acct. We will proceed with this protocol in the future.Â 
I had selected "refund" thinking, we logged a payment, but had to "give back" in system.
I apologize for the mistake. I voided the refund check in the guarantor acct, but can you please ensure a check has not already been processed and mail in these 3 days? Thank you so much!
