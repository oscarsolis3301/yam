Hi Kaja,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1981730.

On review FA# 860909758 for DOS 07/14/2025 plan Operating Engineers Trust Funds PPO - Dental / UCR attached as primary coverage, Verified FA and Dental Eligibility found this patient has UCR fees attached however when comparing the EOB the fees are reflecting as per plan Operating Engineers OON fee schedule so showing underpayment. Verified paper EOB from Onbase found Non Network. Hence routing to Eligibility re- verify the plan and benefits for the coverage attached. 

Thank you
