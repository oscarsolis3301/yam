## Description

MOM WAS LETTING ME KNOW THAT PT WAS GOING TO START SCHOOL OVER SEA'S AND THE SCHEDULED APPT THAT WE HAVE FOR ORTHO 8/21/2025 WILL BE HIS LAST VISIT WITH US AS HE WILL HAVE TO START ORTHO OVER THERE. SHE WANTS TO KNOW WHAT HER BALANCE WOULD BE TO RENDER SERVICES AT THAT TIME SO THAT SHE CAN PAY THE BALANCE AT THE NEXT VISIT BEFORE THEY LEAVE. WE WILL NOT BE REMOVING ANYTHING AS MOM SAYS THAT SHE WILL TAKE HIM STRAIGHT TO AN ORTHODONTIST WHEN THEY ARRIVE.
