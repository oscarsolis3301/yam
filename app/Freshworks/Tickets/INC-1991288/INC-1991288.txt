## Description

New team member Masuda Hamidzadah (95292) does not have access to Microsoft Suite, Jira, Confluence, and Smartsheet through her pdshealth Okta. She is unable to sign into Microsoft to obtain direct access. We attempted to set up her pacificdental Okta to see if she could access these products, but she was unable to sign in due to the daily password change limit (she had already changed her password from the temporary one).

Masudaâ€™s first day is today, August 1, 2025.
