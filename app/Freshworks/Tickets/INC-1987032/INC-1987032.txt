On review FA#854882685 Found plan Delta Dental of CA PPO - Dental / Delta Preferred attached as primary coverage and found same plan is attached in DE form. Verified Epic EOB but could not able to find the reason for less payment, Verified OnBase but unable to access Â and verified CyberArk for paper EOB but not found. Verified DE form found comments as PPO-EMP FEES SCH=PT'S COPAY , so requesting for paper EOB for more verification. Thank You
