Hi Beatrice,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1988005.

Thank you for that additional information.  When a provider is added the day after we have to manually assign their resources so that appointments can be scheduled.  I have made this update and you will now be able to schedule.  


Regards, 

Greg MEpic Support

Yes, we can't transfer pts to her schedule.  She was in our office yesterday and we can move pts over. We have correctly configured the schedule.

Hi Beatrice,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1988005.

Can you please be more specific and provide additional details including a screenshot?  We are not able to troubleshoot with only "...having issues with her release date?"  

You can also get additional information on configuring provider templates and release dates by accessing the SRG titled "Build and Manage Templates" located on the Front Office Learning Home Dashboard by pressing F1 when logged in to Epic.

Hi Beatrice,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1988005.

Thank you for submitting this request.  Kaylee Workman is already added to the public snapboard at #19/Yorba Linda.  Please make sure you are using the public snapboard (there should not be a padlock icon next to the name) and not a custom/private view as the Epic Team/IT does not maintain those for users.  There is also no template configured for this provider at #19/Yorba Linda today so you will need to make sure it is not open at another PDS office, then define the slots and blocks for them before scheduling patients.  




Regards,

Ok.
That is an issue that will need to be addressed by the Epic Schedule team.
I will send the ticket over to them.
