Hi Silvia,

The provider record has been updated in Epic and is on the department HPU Randolph snapboard. Remember
to use the Edit Template features to set the provider's resource column Release
Date to M+18. Please make sure to run the department snapboard to view changes.


Please note that if you are working off of a private/personal snapboard, there
is a lock icon to the left of the snapboard name, these updates will not be
reflected.
