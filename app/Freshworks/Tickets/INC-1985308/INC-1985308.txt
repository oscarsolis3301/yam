Go to System &gt; Settings &gt; Admin &gt; Communication &gt; Network2. Look at DHCP in the top right3. If it’s on, set it to Off4. Fields for IP address, subnet mask, and gateway will appear (or have already been there if the DHCP was set to off).I checked the IP address in adapt and it shows 10.52.152.0 for office 244She said IP shows 192.168.3.11She said the subnet showed 24 so I had her set it to 255. Leave the IP address alone.6. Set the subnet mask to 25.7. Set the gateway to X.X.X.129, replacing the first three X’s with the IP scheme of the office8. Hit Save9. Go back into Network10. Turn DHCP back On11. Hit Save12. Go to System &gt; Status &gt; Info13. Ensure that the IP address doesn’t say either DISCONNECTED or 192.168.3.11a. If it does this means that there’s an issue in the network roomi. If you’re comfortable, guide them through finding the oralyzer ethernet cable in the network room and have them plug it into ports 9 through 11 on the switch closest to the wall.1. If it is plugged into the right port on the switch, this means that the VLAN is wrong. Send the ticket to field.ii. If you’re not comfortable, send the ticket to field.14. Check the home screen and check on the ethernet icon at the top of the screen. It should appear white in a minute or two if it isn’t already white.15.
