Hi Avinash,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1987525.

Are you logging into Toolkit through CyberArk? Right now DeltaToolkit is not working through CyberArk. You will need to download a fresh copy of the spreadsheet and manually login to his payer website. Will you please try to login manually and see if you are getting the same result as if you were using CyberArk? Please let me know what you are seeing.

Hi Avinash,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1987525.




It has to be a office, how are you getting a link thru fresh service. You may need to contact your IT department cause without an office#, I dont understand what link you are getting thru fresh service. You access Delta thru CyberArk.

Hello,




This is not specific to any offices, this link we are receiving from the payer through Freshservice and Offshore (our) is the only team that not able to access this link where onshore team can able to access the website.

We have a backlog to complete please look at this issue as earliest, Thank you.
