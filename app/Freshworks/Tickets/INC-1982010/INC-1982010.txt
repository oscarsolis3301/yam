Hi Naveenkumar Dillibabu

Thank you for reaching out to Patient Benefits. 
We have updated the dental eligibility form to reflect the most current benefit information. 
Please note, if you notice the coverage does not appear to be attached in the registration, please take the following steps to attach the coverage: 



 Open the Coverage Wizard, by using the “Add Coverage” link located in the top right-hand corner of the Guarantors &amp; Coverages section in the registration view. 
Once in the Coverage Wizard, there will be Coverages located under the search bar. 
Select the coverage that needs to be attached. 
To complete the process, click on the “Finish” button at the bottom left of the screen. 
It is also important to ensure the coverage is attached to the “Visit Info”

Hi Naveenkumar,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1982010.



Correction in notes - On review found fees populating correctly for code D7140 in FA#865017800, Patient has primary coverage United Concordia / Advantage Plus fees link attached UNITED CONCORDIA - ADVANTAGE PLUS - Advantage Plus SoCal Reg 19. Verified dental eligibility found UNITED CONCORDIA [1211], ADVANTAGE PLUS with status Verified by Auto Eligibility. When we review the EOB claim not processed based on the Advantage Plus PPO fees. As per credentialing grid billing provider status is active for DOS. Hence routed to eligibility to re-verify the eligibility and attach the correct plan to patient coverage &amp; FA. Please let me know for any additional questions. Thank You
