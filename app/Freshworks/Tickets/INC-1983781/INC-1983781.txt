## Description

I am a new employee and only seeing pdshealth.okta.com on my personal cell phone. I do not see pacificdental.okta.com. In reading the QRG, it states "Please do not remove the pacificdental.okta.com account at this time, as that will cause access issues."  What happens in my case where I don't have both accounts?
