Hi Murugapriya,


On review FA#853529874 found plan Delta Dental of AZ PPO - Dental / Delta Premier attached as primary coverage for the DOS 07/03/2025 code D4342 UR &amp; LR was populating correctlyeith deductibles $50.00. Verified EOB found the code D4342 UR &amp; LR was allowed less than the expected amount with deductible $50.00 without any specific reason. Upon reviewing the allowed amount matching with delta prefered for the code D4342. Checked in CG billing provider is active with Delta Dental. Hence routing this ticket to eligibility team for plan verification. Thank youPlease find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1987040.
