Per review in previous history claim processed and denied as Invalid Florida blue NPI and no OON benefits available. Checked in Credential Grid, the provider LISA M PETERS NPI#1881714293 LIC#DN14918 status showing active and effective from 1/25/2019. Still rep stating the provider is OON. Per Ticket tracker found ticket#INC-1900830 got response as ""Upon checking CG provider is effective from 01/25/2019 and upon checking roster provider cannot be found. As the claim was denied need EOB to reach out to the payer. Please raise another ticket with attached EOB."". Per review in web unable to get paper EOB. Per review in Cyberark Availity is not listed under off#962. Hence creating Cyberark ticket and routing to ICS Inquiry to call &amp; get paper EOB for the claim.
