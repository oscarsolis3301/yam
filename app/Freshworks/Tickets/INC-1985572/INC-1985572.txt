Hi Lani,

I just called and was unable to reach you. I have downloaded an application called Dell Command Update on your laptop. Making sure the laptop is connected to a charger and has some internet connection. You can launch the application and hit "Check" It should find some updates missing or needed. Hit the box that says automatically restart and then press install. It will take between 10-15 to install updates and once it restart, please do not touch the laptop as it will install a bios update and will come back to the login screen eventually. If there are any questions please let me know!
