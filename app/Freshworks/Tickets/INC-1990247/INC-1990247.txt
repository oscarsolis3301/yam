## Description

Hello,
Patient Meghan Webster, Guar ID 12192330, has a pending CareCredit refund submitted yesterday, approved by my RM Dave Donohoue. She needs this refund pushed through ASAP as it was supposed to have been submitted on 7/16/25 but was not submitted to the correct account on that day, and her payment for CareCredit is coming due on 08.03.25 and she said she does not know how to make payments to CareCredit. Can you please help me push her CareCredit refund through fully so it gets back to her CareCredit account ASAP?Â 
Thank you so much,
Emma Johansson
