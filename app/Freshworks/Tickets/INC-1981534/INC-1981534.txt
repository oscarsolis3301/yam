Hi Chanthapanyaongl,

I hope you're doing well.

We are unable to merge the two accounts as requested because the guarantors are from different service areas.

Kandace M. Haney (Guarantor #11008552, MRN #24299043) - Office #1020, Leesburg 1
Dave Haney (Guarantor #7234373, MRN #12508969) - Office #226, Tramonto

Additionally, the guarantor accounts for Kandace Haney and Dave Haney cannot be merged due to mismatched details (name, gender). Kandace Haney is listed as a patient under Dave Haney's guarantor account (#7234373), with an MRN of 12508971. However, she already has a separate MRN (#24299043) and guarantor account (#11008552) under her own name.

Please contact your Regional Analyst for guidance on how to remove Kandace M. Haney's account information, particularly the MRN, from Dave Haney's account.

Thank you! Please let us know if you need further assistance.

Best regards,Stephanie Henry
