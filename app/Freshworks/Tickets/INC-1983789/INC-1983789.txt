Hi Amanda,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1983789.




Thank you for reaching out to Patient Benefits. Unfortunately, we are unable to verify the benefits.


Please see below for resolution details:
• We have reached out to the carrier; however, due to long hold times we were unable to reach a live rep.


We do apologize for the inconvenience.

Kindly,
