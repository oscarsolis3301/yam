Hi Navaneethan,

On review FA#854711621 the plan Blue Cross Blue Shield of NM PPO / Dentemax PPO as primary coverage for DOS 07/10/2025 code D3330 was populating correctly. Checked in DE form the benefits are not matching with EOB for the code D3330. In EOB the code D3330 was allowed less than the expected amount but the patient pays is reflecting with high charge amount. Checked in CG the billing provider is INN with Dentemax. As per the paper EOB found that the allowed amount for code D3330 is $625 but patient resp doesn't match. Hence routing this ticket to eligibility team for plan and benefit verification and route back to fees team for further review. Thank you
