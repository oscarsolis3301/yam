Hi baylie.catrett,
Per the SRG, Prism will update over night.  You should double check tomorrow to make sure the update completed appropriately.  If it did not, you will need to work with payroll to make the correction.Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1984490.

Thanks, 
Mandie

Hello,

I edited the template in epic so it reflects the correct schedule 7/28/2025. Is there anything left for me to do on my part?

Thank you,
Baylie Catrett

Hi baylie.catrett,
Please review the attached SRG regarding Ensuring Provider Pay Accuracy.  The SRG is also available by clicking F1 in Epic.  You should have until tomorrow to edit the template to make the needed corrections.  Once the template is closed you will need to reference the SRG for next steps.Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1984490.
