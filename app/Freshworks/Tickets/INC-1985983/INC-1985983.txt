## Description

Dr Gaffino likes to specifically use 'Brush &amp; Bond bonding agent kit' for her composite restorations. It is not included in the Dentira formulary and she would like to continue to use it moving forward. Please add it at the earliest convenience. I believe the vendor is Parkell.

Hi Heather! Sorry to keep going back and forth and taking time away from you, but the Brush&amp;Bond kit that Dr Gaffino had requested only had the bond liquid that was added to Dentira. She requires the entire kit as it includes the activator brushes that go specifically
 with that brand of bonding liquid as the brushes are specially treated with a chemical activator to enhance the Brush&amp;Bond's self-etching chemistry. Thank you so much for your attention to this matter!
