Hi Mohammed Minhaj

Thank you for reaching out to Patient Benefits. 
We have updated the dental eligibility form to reflect the most current benefit information. 
Please note, if you notice the coverage does not appear to be attached in the registration, please take the following steps to attach the coverage: 



 Open the Coverage Wizard, by using the “Add Coverage” link located in the top right-hand corner of the Guarantors &amp; Coverages section in the registration view. 
Once in the Coverage Wizard, there will be Coverages located under the search bar. 
Select the coverage that needs to be attached. 
To complete the process, click on the “Finish” button at the bottom left of the screen. 
It is also important to ensure the coverage is attached to the “Visit Info”

On review FA#856089260 found plan Unitedhealth Group PPO - Dental / Dental Benefit Providers PPO attached as primary coverage with Benefits updated after record was finalized. Replace to update amounts. verified DE Form found same plan is attached. Verified EOB found Code D2950 is altered to code D2949 with reason code B3F Buildup has been denied. Records do not show large loss of toothstructure. Alternate benefit to a restorative foundation granted. Code D2740 allowed correct amount with reason code K69 Patient responsible for difference in cost between service rendered and the fee for the service on which the plan benefit is based. Verified credentialing found billing provider is INN with DBP/UHC. Verified DE form found some codes need to be updated , Hence routing to eligibility for benefit verification. Thank You
