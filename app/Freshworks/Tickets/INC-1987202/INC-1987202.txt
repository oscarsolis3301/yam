## Description

Ins exp is $0.00 and found Ins DBP was revised as $0.01 for banding 2/6/2025 with the description of """"unbilled"""". Ins paid $300.00 for banding and received 252 dnl as attachment required and also verified in OnBase and found that the same dnl is mentioned in electronic EOB and also checked in the website but not able to check the claim status . Hence as the claim is billed as unbilled need to calculate the reimbursement and credit calculator but as the banding claim is dnd for 252 but there is no information what information do they required . Hence moving to ICS to verify the information and as there is no available WQ created trace ticket
