Checked in De form the plan   SOLSTICE HMO [218], ESSENTIALSMILE TOTAL CARE ADULT with status Verified by Front Office. checked in EOB the code D1110 was allowed correctly but paid less than the expected amount, verified in Registration found the adult plan was attached but the patient age is 16. Hence routing this ticket to eligibility team for plan reverification. Thank you
