## Description

per EPIC review AETNA HMO denied the banding claim as 96-NON-COVERED CHARGES also policy termed on 05/03/2024. HUMANA PPO was effective from 06/03/2024 and paid from 6/24-9/24 as per call notes "After this the payment was stopped as the total months of treatment completed which is only 12 months" so previous user created Cj plan for remaining unpaid balance. Upon reviewing found for 7/24 we have received two payment under the same check/EFT#2797731 but upon check found the payment was received under different claim #202503247702283 and #202503247688087 so moved the claim to ICS trace ticket to check the payment info and deferred the open WQ for 14 days and once we have received response will work accordingly
