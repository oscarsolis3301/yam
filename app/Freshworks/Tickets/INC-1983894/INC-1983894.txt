Hi Genesis,

Account audit can be located via guarantor docs under services rendered calculations - patient credit is reflecting higher than calculations due to 2 additional payments being received concluding rendering of service. Office needs to submit change request form ensuring contract is cancelled as well as submit refund to patient for the true amount of $2234.96 due to them. Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1983894.

Thank you for reaching out regarding Services Rendered. There is no help ticket needed for this process. Please navigate to the "Orthodontic Treatment Discontinued" SRG in Epic to have services Rendered. The SRG will instruct office to charge out the D8999.Z treatment discontinued code. Once completed, this invoice will be reviewed and completed through ROC Charge Review WQ and the patients clinical status will be updated accordingly.
