Good afternoon,
Can you please re-issue a $52 refund check for patient Keith Krantz? Patient moved from the address we had when the check was issued so he never received it. Address is now updated in patient's chart. Thank you!

Hi Vanessa,

Check
remains outstanding, I have voided and cancelled on my end. I will reassign
ticket to the refund department for them to void and reprocess refund to updated address.
