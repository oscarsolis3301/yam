## Description

 As per review found ins paid $714.49 from banding till 7/2025 including records and no denial as of now so left that it is. Upon checking the payments found there is missing payment for dos 8/2024 , so checked in OnBase and website unable to find the payment for 8/2024, and also checked previous notes found previously user raised trace ticket and we got response as "rep stated that they initially paid for DOS 08/2024 for $17.71 and then it was recouped due to they already overpaid for initial banding code by paying $35.42. So, no payment will be made to 08/2024." in this response rep stated that they will not made payment for 8/2024 but upon checking the banding claim is paid for the banding and 1/24 and there is no any other payment made, found again the claim has been moved to ICS inquiry but found there is no response receive from their end. Need to know why they didn't paid for dos 8/2024 and need to verify whether they will pay or not, so again moving the claim to ICS inquiry to verify the payment details , but as there is no any other WQ hence created trace ticket
