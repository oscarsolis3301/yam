Hi Sachin Jacob

Thank you for reaching out to Patient Benefits. 
We have updated the dental eligibility form to reflect the most current benefit information. 
Please note, if you notice the coverage does not appear to be attached in the registration, please take the following steps to attach the coverage:

Once in the Coverage Wizard, there will be Coverages located under the search bar. 
Select the coverage that needs to be attached. 
To complete the process, click on the “Finish” button at the bottom left of the screen. 
It is also important to ensure the coverage is attached to the “Visit Info”

Hi Sachin,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1984623.



On review found fees populating correctly for code D1110 in FA#863091554. Patient has primary coverage Unitedhealth Group PPO - Dental / First Dental Health PPO fees link attached First Dental Health - First Dental Health PPO. Verified dental eligibility found UNITED HEALTHCARE PPO [872], FIRST DENTAL HEALTH PPO with status Verified by Front Office. When we review the EOB claim processed based on the Dental Benefit Providers PPO fees. As per credentialing grid billing provider status is active for DOS. Hence routed to eligibility to re-verify the eligibility and attach the correct plan to patient coverage &amp; FA. Please let me know for any additional questions. Thank You
