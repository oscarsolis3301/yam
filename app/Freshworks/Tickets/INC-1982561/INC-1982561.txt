## Description


I am trying to verify a patient's insurance for his upcoming appointment this Friday. I called the dental eligibility to see how much maximum he had left because it wasn't updating even though he came multiple times this year. I spoke to a rep and she said they have no record of any claims sent in. I told her he has been here multiple times this year and we have never been paid for any visits. She then stated we have to physically send the claims into them thru email or mail: claims@ipmtrust.com or 1168 E La Cadena Drive. Riverside CA 92507. In his guarantor it says the claim was accepted by payer, he has been coming since April this year. 4/3/25, 5/29/25 and 6/27/25, none of these claims have been paid.
