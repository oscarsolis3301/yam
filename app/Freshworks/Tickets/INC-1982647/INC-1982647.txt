Hi Lindsey,


Thank you for placing a ticket. The reason the sidebar is showing no history is because no history was filed in that encounter. 

We are working with Epic to update this so that the date looks to all current and past encounters for the actual last filed date. We have added this ticket to that project and will continue working toward a solution.
