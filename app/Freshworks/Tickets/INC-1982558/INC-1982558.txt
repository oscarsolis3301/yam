## Description


Good Morning, 




I have a newly hired doctor Amulya Kotha, that will be starting 8/20/25, she has not received the email for her to submit credentialling documents and I wanted to be sure that we are sending to her personal email as she hasn't officially gotten access to her
 PDS email. 




Her personal email is   amulya.kotha16@gmail.com











Thank you, 




Valerie Van Doren |
