Hi Doug, random question. We have a nearby office whose doctor is out on vacation. My doctor is asking me if we were to borrow their scanner in the mean time, is it easy/possible to get it hooked up to our office internet if we wanted to? Just trying to map out our options here if this is not a quick/easy fix

Called the office but Madi was unavailable.

The issue has now escalated. We tried to calibrate the camera and it will not even do the calibration process. When I try to calibrate, the camera is not working
