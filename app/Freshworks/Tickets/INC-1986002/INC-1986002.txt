Hi Brenda,

Thanks
for reaching out to us!
 
 We have verified a temp fee outage. Fees are
being fixed. In the interim, office should utilize fee finder to manually
coordinate pt fees for upcoming appointments.
 
I
will update &amp; resolve your ticket once fees have been verified in epic.

On review FA# 874094016, 874595513 for  plan Blue Cross Blue Shield of OK PPO - Dental / Dnoa PPO attached as Secondary coverage and fees link not attached showing only dashes. Verified EPIC Plan Reimbursement Page found fees contract for plan Dnoa PPO termed on 07/23/2025 and not yet started for DOS 08/06/2025. So please manually override with the FS available in Fee finder. Hence routing to Jocelyn Scott for further review
