Patient had prepaid for treatment on 7/14 but insurance on 7/20 sent to the patient OON check. Then self pay credit absorbed by the self pay balance push from insurance except took what pt prepaid for treatment. if we can have the funds paid on 7/14 to be pushed back for todays visit 7/29, the visit pt prepaid for, pt and office would greatly appreciate, pt still claims to not have received OON check yet.
