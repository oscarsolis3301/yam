Hi Rayesha,

If the provider is no longer with PDS the OD will need to take over the encounter and close them on the providers behalf. If they is no immediate OD at the office you can contact the RM to see who would take over the encounters. We are unable to close or cancel the encounters for providers no longer with PDS. The ticket is being closed so that you may work with your OD on closing the encounters or the RM on who will be responsible to close the open encounters for this provider.Â Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1991579.
