Hi Jennifer,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1981557.

Your pdshealth.com email address wasn't in the exception, which is why you didn't receive the email. Your pdshealth.com and also Daisy LaCour's pdshealth.com email address were added to the exception. You should be able to receive emails with that URL type in them.

Thanks,
Mary Patton

Thanks for the additional information Jennifer! I'm opening a ticket with Proofpoint to see if it was blocked from being delivered to you from there. If it was, I'll have Thomas Romero's email address whitelist to prevent it from happening again. I'll keep you posted.

Hi Mary, 
I did not received the email from Tom Romero. Others on the distribution did receive it. 
I received it by it being forwarded by our claim adjuster at Gallagher Bassett, Patricia Gomez. I was able to open the link from within her email.

The email that is attached to the ticket. Were you able to receive it and not access the link inside it or did you not receive the email but others were able to? 

Thanks,

Hi Jennifer,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1981557.

There is a exception in place in the system to allow these emails to be delivered to your inbox. Not quite sure what happened in this instance, but I'll send your ticket over to that team to look into it.
