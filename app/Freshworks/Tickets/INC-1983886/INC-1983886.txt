Hi Brenda,

There
was a temp fee outage during DOS. Fees have since been verified in epic and now
populating as of this morning.

There
is a gap in the reimbursement contract from 07/27/2025 to 07/29/2025 so the
office will need to manually coordinate PT fees for any DOS in this time fame using link below.

Thank
You.

Hi Brenda,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1983886.

On review FA# 873653546 plan Deltacare HMO - Dental / C73 attached as Primary coverage and fees link attached for plan 10A. Verified Fee System plan C73 is already available in Fee System. Verified EPIC Reimbursement Contract Upload Page found that Fee contract for plan C73 termed on 07/27/2025 and restarted on 07/29/2025. Hence routing to Jocelyn Scott for further review. Please manually override the fee schedule and minimum guar available in Fee Finder. 

Thank you
