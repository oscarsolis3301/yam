Hi Nivetha,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1981802.

On review FA# 783944621 for DOS 04/09/2025 plan Blue Cross Blue Shield of MN Federal / Anthem Blue Cross Ppo100 attached as Secondary coverage, Verified Dental Eligibility found same plan is attached however when comparing the EOB the fees are reflecting as per DNoA PPO so showing underpayment for code D1110 . Hence routing to Eligibility re- verify the plan and benefits for the coverage attached. Thank You
