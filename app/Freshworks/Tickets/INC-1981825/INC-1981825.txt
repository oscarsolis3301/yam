## Description

checked Website for CIGNA HMO and found there is an insurance payment till 06/2025 and also a payment of $33.00 for D0330 code for final records DOS and but those payments are not posted in EPIC (05/2025 &amp; 06/2025 and D0330 final records) and previous user created a Posting HT#: 1862071 and received response as "rep El informed rep as we are missing the payment for month of June 2025 so rep stated as we will cover for 24 months and this plan has 18 months and it will end on 6/2025. and the claim was last payment made on April-May 2025 and rep stated the debanded was done on April 2025 so rep verified and stated will sent the claim for reprocess to get the payment for june 2025 and deband must be on June 2025 not in April 2025 so they send back for reprocess under claim# 8611561, so need to allow some time 10b days, and for code D0330 deband payment it was included D8999 for ortho records and the payment will be processed as copay no additional payment  and the copay$270.00. call ref#32380728 ." so previous user worked and raised trace ticket # 1942665 to verify the reprocess status and received response as "it was reprocessed on 06/13/2025 and stated as the patient has debanded earlier on 04/09/2025 and so they paid for that and no more payments will be made as the patient was completed the treatment. Cigna will pay for 24 M unless the patient has treatment length was completed or patient policy was termed which ever comes first here patient debanded earlier. No more payments will be made. call ref#32434548 ". Upon review both response was contradictory need to know the whether ins pay further or not also meed to know which is the correct deband date  to work further.  In EPIC there is no invoice to route ICS. Hence, opened the  ICS trace help ticket
