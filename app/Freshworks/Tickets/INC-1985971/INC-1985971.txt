Hi Vanessa,

You have access to the offices front office pool, You may not be seeing the folder because someone else may have cleared it out or you may not see all Contact Center messages because you don't have access to the back office pool. Should you need access to all contact center messages the OM will need to grant you that access. They would need to open in-basket, select
manage pools from the screen, then search the pool they want to add the user
to, after that they then search for the user and add them to that pool, finally
they will accept and the user will have access to the assigned pool. The user
might have to log in to the pool or they can also log out and back in to Epic.
