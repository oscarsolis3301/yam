Hi Gregory,

Per posting, due to a refund was requested under ref#D267309698 they are not able to correct the payer to the correct payer. Please review as a check tracer would need to be sent to be sure check does not go out and voided as posting cannot correct once a refund check has been attached. Also please review payment#D267309698 per remit tracker shows as missing D267309698. Thank you!Â
