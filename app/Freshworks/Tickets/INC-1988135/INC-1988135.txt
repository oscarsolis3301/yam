## Description


Hello,
 
Can we start a new ticket? I’m a consultant working with Tory Helvey, JT Bridwell, and Fran Stevens. I only work on Thur. and Fri. so I have not been able to address the steps provided in the communication below. Can you have someone reach
 out to make sure I’m set up correctly.
 
I work from home in Bowling Green, KY. I am not at any of your office locations.
 
Thank you,
 
-Tabatha Eatherly

Action Needed: Register in New Okta Tenant by July
 30






 

As part of our transition to PDS Health, we’re moving from the existing Pacific Dental Services Okta tenant to a new PDS Health Okta tenant. This transition ensures you’ll continue
 to enjoy a seamless and secure Single Sign-On (SSO) experience that aligns with our new brand.

 

What’s Changing?




You can now access your applications via the PDS Health Okta webpage at
https://pdshealth.okta.com/.

Okta is discontinuing the Okta Mobile app. Access your Okta dashboard from Okta Verify.
You’ll use the same authentication methods, Okta Verify or text message, when you need to reset your password.


 
Action Required
Please make sure to register in the new Okta Tenant and enroll in Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) by July
 30.


Click the following link to start the transition:
https://pdshealth.okta.com/





Check out our helpful
QRG
for step-by-step instructions


If you’ve created Okta bookmarks, you’ll need to recreate them on the new PDS Health Okta tenant, they
 will not transfer.
This
 guide
shows you how to add bookmarks. 



 
Please note that when you start enrolling in the new tenant, there will be no apps present on your Okta dashboard during the transition
 period.   
 

What’s Staying the Same?



Your existing credentials (username and password) will remain the same
You will continue to access your applications through the same Okta tiles on your apps dashboard


 

If you have any questions, please create a Service Desk ticket using this dedicated link:
PDS Health
 Transition.


 

Thank you for your cooperation as
we make this migration and ensure a secure network.
