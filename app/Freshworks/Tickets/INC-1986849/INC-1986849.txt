## Description

Training laptop has message - Critical Error - your start menu is  not working We will try to fix next time signing in. When I login again it will do it again. I can click on Chrome ICON and it will take me to Google intranet. Do not know if storage is the issue. Would want to try to access Epic environments as it is a training laptop.
