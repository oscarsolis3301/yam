## Description

on 7/25/2025 I took payment of $1,813 from patient Jacky Alonso and it was entered in the wrong account under Jeffery Clark ( MRN 26025034). My RM had me go to Billing Activities, select Jeffery Clark, and do a give back payment. 
Since that date till 7.30.25 I asked Jacky Alonso if she received the money back on her card and she stated she did not.
Please see attached of the payment void under Jeffery Clark.
I would like to know if we received the funds of $1813 or to confirm that it was sent back to patient Jacky Alonso.
