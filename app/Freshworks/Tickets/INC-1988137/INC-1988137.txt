## Description

Hello, About to months ago I placed a ticket (INC -1878026) for replacement parts for my scanner that is not working. I was told that the parts would arrive between 2-4 business days. However, I never received any parts in the mail. I asked for a tracking number and never received it as well after 13 of not getting anything. IT Inventory MGMT # 1014247
