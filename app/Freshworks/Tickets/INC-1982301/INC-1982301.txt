Hi Evelyn,

Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1982301.

I was able to free up a license and have assigned it to you. The changes we are making will take two weeks, so I wanted to ensure that you have access now. I will route this ticket to our desktop team to assist you with the adim rights install.

Hi Evelyn,

We are currently transitioning from our VIP agreement with Adobe to an ETLA. There may be a delay until we have access to the new admin console and can assign the license. I’ll keep you posted as we progress.
