Hi there, I secured this account in a spay but it is showing unsecured and no contract in guarantor docs. Is there an issue on the spay side?

Hi Raelynn,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1985273.



It could have been a glitch in the system. Unfortunately, we wouldn't know why it didn't process. The system doesn't provide that kind of information. 

Thank you

I set this up in operatory 1. Why would it not register on your end?





Take Care,

Hello, 
There are no known issues with Smartpay. We do not see any Smartpay Arrangements setup for this patient. Or any manuals scan into this patient's guarantor docs. You will need to go through the setup process again in order to secure the patient's balance. We have also attached a manual form to be used if you are having issues setting up the arrangement in Olly/FMP. 
 Please feel free to reach out with any further questions or concerns. 
Thank you
