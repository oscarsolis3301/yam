Per EOB we have received OON payment stating remark as "Benefit as based on use of Non contracted dentist". Per credential grid provider, KATIE BUTTERFIELD- NPI- 1427547058  active from 9/1/2019. Previously Ticket#1927729  was created which closed  as provider is INN, effective from 9/1/2019,as checked in Anthem roster found the provider is active on the same eff date 9/1/2019, and if the claim still denies kindly reach out to billing team in terms of credentialing the provider..
