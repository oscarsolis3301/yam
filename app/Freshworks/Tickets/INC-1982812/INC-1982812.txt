Hi alicia.nicolas,



There was a temp fee outage for this plan during DOS. Fees
have been verified in epic and now populating as of today.

There
is a gap in the reimbursement contract from 07/27/2025 to 07/29/2025 so the
office will need to manually coordinate PT fees for any DOS in this time fame.

For
further questions or concerns, please let us know.

Thank
You.
Josie
Scott

On review FA# 873095334, 873111097,873261352  for the DOS 07/29/2025 plan Deltacare HMO - Dental / C73 attached as primary coverage and fees are showing dashes in  FA. Verified DE form found same plan is attached . Verified Epic Reimbursement page  found fees contract termed on 07/27/2025 and not yet started.  So please manually override with the FS attached here.. Hence routing to Jocelyn Scott for further review
