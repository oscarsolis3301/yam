## Description

 As per review, found the Ins paid $ 596.00 for banding and records . No dnl as of now in epic. The total insurance paid $ 596.00 and excess paid $305.00 and outstanding credit is $ 300.00 . As the insurance overpaid checked the HMO credit calculator using fee schedule but as there is no copay amounts for the ortho code , also verified the other fee schedule no ortho codes co pay is found. Hence raised an trace ticket to get the copay allowed amount . Once response received will work accordingly. Deferred the credits for 14 days.
