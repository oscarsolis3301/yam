## Description

As per review found we received payment for the banding DOS 06/25 and initial records but treatment length was completed. Previous user has already moved to ICS trace to verify why ins is paying less but received response was not valid. So again checked reimbursement and found that ins will pay up to $1500.00. and created ICS trace ticket# to verify why ins didn't pay the full expect as per F/A
