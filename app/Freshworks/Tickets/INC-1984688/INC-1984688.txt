Hi Naveen,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1984688.



Thank you for reaching out to Patient Benefits! 

Unfortunately, we are unable to verify dental benefits due to third party issues. 

Per insurance rep, they are unable to provide patient information and benefits to ‘third party administrators’. 

The verification request will now become the office’s responsibility to complete. 

We do apologize for the inconvenience.

Kindly,


Monica Araiza |  Representative, ROC Service Desk | Patient Benefits
