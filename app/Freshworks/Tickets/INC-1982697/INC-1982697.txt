## Description

This ticket was sent by Maintenance: The X-Ray remote box where you plug the sensor into is not working. We have only recently starting using this device, so I am not sure what is wrong with it. I have tried different sensors/chords/computers, but it is only the remote itself that will not connect. It will not show any lights when I plug it up.
