Hi Infant,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1981783.



On review found fees populating correctly for codes D0120, D1110, D1206 in FA#858265635. Patient has primary coverage Unitedhealth Group PPO - Dental / UCR same fees link attached. Verified dental eligibility found UNITED HEALTHCARE PPO [872], UCR with status Verified by Front Office. When we review the EOB claim processed based on the Dental Benefit Providers PPO fees. As per credentialing grid billing provider status is active for DOS. Hence routed to eligibility to re-verify the eligibility and attach the correct plan to patient coverage &amp; FA. Please let me know for any additional questions. Thank You
