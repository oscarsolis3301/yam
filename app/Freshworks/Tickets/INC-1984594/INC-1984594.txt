Hi Pooja,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1984594.

On review found fees populating correctly for codes D2391, D2392 and applied Alternate benefit code D2140, D2150 in FA#859867903. Patient has Primary coverage Humana / Humana Dental PPO same fees link attached. Verified dental eligibility found HUMANA [940], HUMANA DENTAL PPO with status ROC Request Pending. When we review the EOB Code D2140 &amp; D2150 processed instead of D2391 &amp; D2392 with no specific reason codes. For code D2140 claim processed based on the Dentemax PPO fees with no specific reason codes. Code D2150 denied with no specific reason codes. Please reach out to insurance for the more clarifications on this denial and alternate code paid. As per credentialing grid billing provider status is INN. Hence routed to eligibility to re-verify the eligibility and attach the correct plan to patient coverage &amp; FA. Please let me know for any additional questions. Thank You
