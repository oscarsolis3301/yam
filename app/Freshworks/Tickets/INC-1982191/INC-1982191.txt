## Description

Hi, 
One of our computers are stuck on the windows loading screen and will not let us fully login. 
We have tried restarting the computer, unplugging the outlet and plugging it back in, and we did not have any luck progressing past the loading screen after inputting login credentials. 

Thanks!
