## Description

A preauthorization was never submitted prior to me working at this office. There is zero insurance expect for Phase II, but insurance is requesting a preauth for tx. I scanned in the HMO Specialty referral into the registration for DOS 2/10/25. Please submit preauth for that DOS. Thank you.Â
