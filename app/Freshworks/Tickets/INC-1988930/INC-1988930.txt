Hi Claudia,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1988930.

As per request need to send corrected claim as veener process and he did not complete the treatment at our office because it was unsatisfactory and did not want to continue treatment with our office and wants to finish the veener crowns somewhere else. we need to return back money from visit 6/11/2025 We need to send corrected claim for getting refund. So for sending corrected claim we need to void (remove) the codes from the invoice. So kindly please remove the non treated code from the invoice and let us know so we could send corrected claim ASAP. Thank you.

Please review the SRG FO_Correct_Treatment_Charged_Out  Please have the Provider follow the steps and uncomplete any incorrect treatment charged out (if requesting to be removed from patient history) OR If treatment was completed but due to patient unsatisfactory, requesting to be removed from patient history. Corrected Claim may be sent once the provider completes the Addendum Workflow, thank you.
