Hi Umesh,

On review FA#860048374 the plan Metlife PPO - Dental / Metlife Pdp as primary coverage for DOS 07/14/2025. Checked in DE form the benefits for code D7000's Series is blank. Checked in EOB the code D7241 was allowed as per the fee schedule but unable to verify the benefits, verified in CG the billing provider is active for the DOS,  hence routing this ticket to eligibility team for benefit verification. Thank you
