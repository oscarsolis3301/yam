Welcome to PDS Health
Start Your Credentialing Process Today!

 
Dear Dr. Jeong Kim,
To ensure we're ready for your first day of patient care, it's important to begin the insurance credentialing process as early as possible. While some key documents will
 only become available after graduation, you can start submitting many of the required items now.
Please review these documents thoroughly, as doing so will help expedite the credentialing process. Be sure to keep a copy of this letter for reference, so you'll know
 exactly what steps to take once your dental license is issued.
Attached are a few documents to help guide you through this initial process.
 
You can provide the below documents by uploading them to your Hub account now:
 
1. CV/Resume Format

- Must include both
education and work history  

- Include your anticipated graduation date

- List PDS Health on your resume using the following format:
MM/YYYY (start date)
Present


- All dates must be formatted as
MM/YYYY - MM/YYYY

- Carriers will not accept a resume with an education and/or work history gap of more than 30 days.

- If there is a gap in your education and/or work history, it must be clearly explained on the CV with corresponding
MM/YYYY - MM/YYYY dates


2. Driver's License, U.S. Passport/State ID - Must be valid and not
 expired


3. Current CPR Card - Can't expire within 45 days of receiving your

2. DEA/Controlled Substance License (if you are going to be prescribing
 medication considered a controlled substance, you will need your federal DEA)

3. NPI Number
- Link to NPPES website:

https://nppes.cms.hhs.gov/
- Please ensure your state dental license is added to the Taxonomy section of your NPPES account.
- Verify you have selected the correct taxonomy code that matches your specialty.
- You'll need the username and password created when your Type 1 NPI was obtained
4. DDS/DMD Diploma

Please note: Once your license is uploaded, complete uploading all your
 credentialing documents to your application through your CredentialStream Hub account and submit.
