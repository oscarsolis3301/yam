## Description

We have several patients threatening to start investigations through Delta Care because our fees do not match their plan booklets. I'm aware of cases such as CAB54 with notations on D2740 that allows you to charge for upgraded materials and charges for porcelain on bicuspids/molars, but most Delta Care plans do not have this stipulation.
Even with CAB54, the plan fee for D2740 is $375 + $325 upgrade fee for Name brand, laboratory processed or in-office processed crowns/pontics produced through specialized technique or materials are material upgrades + $150 for Porcelain/ceramic crown, pontic and fixed bridge retainer on molars are considered a material upgrade. The total for this is also only $850 and this fee also populates at $923. 
My patient yesterday, Luis A Gonzalez Acosta, he was seen for D2740 and D2950 and D3221. When populating his fee for Porcelain it populated at $923. He has CA11I. D2740 with CA11I in his plan booklet is only $240, there are not any notations in his plan fee schedule that states we are able to charge for an upgrade or anything. I'd like to know how we got the fees of $923 when it says $240? 
There are several patients that I have had these issues with. 
Another patient is Josephine Wheeler, MRN: 26017968. Her porcelain also populated at the same amount, $923, she has DeltaCare CA11A. Her fee for Porcelain is also $240, and there are not any notations stating we can charge for upgraded materials or molar teeth. 

This is how it populates for ALL of my patients. 

Can I get some insight on to where and how we get these fees, and if this is a system error.
