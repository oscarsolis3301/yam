On review FA# 874660180 for DOS 05/08/2024 plan Liberty Dental Plan PPO / Alignment Allowance attached as Primary coverage and fees link not attached and codes are manually overridden. Verified Dental Eligibility found LIBERTY DENTAL PLAN PPO [641], ALIGNMENT ALLOWANCE with status Verified by front office and Frequency details are missing. Verified Fee System plan Alignment Allowance not available and verified Credentialing status Liberty PPO is not available. Hence routing to Eligibility for plan re-verification. 

Thank you
