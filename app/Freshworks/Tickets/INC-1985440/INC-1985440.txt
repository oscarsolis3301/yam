Hi Brittany.fisher,

I have determined what I believe explains the issue that was seen.  The patient that did not show up on the snapboard but was scheduled was MRN 16844815.  This patient was originally scheduled on column 1 for the provider (Moosa 1) at 11am.  However, yesterday (7/29) at 4:14PM, Clayton Wright changed the appointment to be with Moosa 2.  This column for this provider is not on the public snapboard.  I have added the 2nd column to the Snapboard.
