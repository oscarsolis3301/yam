## Description

Good afternoon.  Can patient balance please be transferred back to insurance for payment?  Claim was denied for OON, however, treatment started on 09/05/2023 with Dr. Laowansiri (contracted 08/22/2022) and was in network for DOS.  Treatment then transferred to Dr. Diana Carvel on 03/07/2024 and she was contracted with Humana HMO on 02/19/2024 which was prior to transferred date and was in network for DOS.
