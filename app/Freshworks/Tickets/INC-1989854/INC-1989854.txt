Hi Aswathy,


On review FA#792512741 found plan Cigna PPO - Dental / Cigna Dental PPO attached as primary coverage for the DOS 07/16/2025 code D1110 was populating correctly. Verified EOB found the code D1110 allowed less than the expected amount with the remark code N130: Consult plan benefit documents/guidelines for information about restrictions for this service.. Verified DE form benefits are matched with the EOB. Checked in CG billing provider is OON for cigna. Hence resolving the ticket.
