Hi Karina,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1983492.



We confirm that the $800.00 guarantor payment posted on 7/24/2025 applied to the balance; after which leaves a remaining balance outstanding of $800.00 which is an indicator that the balance was $800.00 higher before it was applied to the account.

The office will need audit the account to ensure the accuracy of what it reflects.
