Hi Katherin,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1983247.



A PDS network account has been created and activated for your new hire. Please see below their credentials:


Username: tramane.munks

E-mail: tramane.munks@pdshealth.com

Since a new account has been created for them, they will need to create their own individual password, via OKTA. Please note that the new password will be the ONLY password this team member will have, and will be valid for the Windows login, OKTA login, email and Epic. The password will automatically expire every 90 calendar day, as per the PDS Security Policy. 

To set a new password, please have them start at https://pacificdental.okta.com and log in with the following credentials:


Username: tramane.munks

Temporary Password: @yT4U6+#8Tyn

They will be prompted to create a new password that must be at least twelve characters long, have at least one capital letter, at least one number, and at least one special character (!@#$% etc, and enroll into Multi-factor Authentication. 


SELF-SERVICE! Please note that once they are able to access OKTA, they will be able to take advantage of Self-Service password reset / account unlock in real time, as long as they provides a secondary (personal) e-mail address and/or a phone number during the initial registration process.

If by any chance they missed that step during the initial enrollment, they can always add a phone number or a secondary e-mail address by going to their Name - Settings - Edit profile in the OKTA dashboard.


If the team member is a brand new hire and they will require Epic access, please make sure they pass their assigned Epic modules and assessments in PDSU, as their Epic access is dependent upon that. If they are a rehire, and they have completed the Epic modules and assessments in PDSU during their previous employment with PDS, there are no prerequisites to login to Epic other than the setup of their PDS password. 


Thank you.
