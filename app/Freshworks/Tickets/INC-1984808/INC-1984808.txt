## Description

Need to work for credits and so verified in fee finder found file but in allowed amount file (Cigna SP OR 30502 Eff 120118) there is no allowed amount for D8020 and in copay file (Cigna Cap Q Series Coinsurance) we don't have the code D8020, so previous user moved to ICS inquiry but the payment was posted back automatically by PB background, so Wq is not available, hence created a trace ticket to get the allowed as well as copay amount for the code D8020
