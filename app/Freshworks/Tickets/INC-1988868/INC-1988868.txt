following steps to attach the coverage: 
      
          1. Open the Coverage Wizard, by using the “Add Coverage” link located in the top right-hand
corner of the Guarantors &amp;                              Coverages section in the registration view. 
          2. Once in the Coverage Wizard, there will be Coverages located under the search bar. 
          3. Select the coverage that needs to be attached. 
          4. To complete the process, click on the “Finish” button at the bottom left of the screen.
