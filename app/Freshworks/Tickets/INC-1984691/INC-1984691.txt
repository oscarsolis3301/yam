Hi Chinnamani,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1984691.
On review FA# 867484321 for DOS 07/22/2025 plan Guardian PPO - Dental / Dentalguard Preferred attached as Primary coverage and fees are populating correctly for code D7210 with Ded $25 and PD of $40.40. Verified EOB insurance allowed less amount for code D7210 (DED $25) without any reason but the allowed amount is matching with Old Fee schedule of plan DentalGuard Preferred. Hence resolving this ticket. Please refile the claim to get correct fees populating. Thank you
