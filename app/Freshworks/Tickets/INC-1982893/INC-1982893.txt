Hi Deoredel,

I hope this email finds you well.

Following my earlier conversation with Faith, the July 25, 2025 refund request was voided/reversed, and the $245.00 payment posted on July 25, 2025, was also voided. Please note that Patient Payments is unable to correct your office's Deposit dashboard.

Thank you. Please let us know if you need any further assistance.

Best regards,Stephanie Henry
