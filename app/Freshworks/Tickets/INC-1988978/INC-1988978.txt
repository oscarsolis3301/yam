Hi Melaney,

Account has been audited as requested for $80 balance. 

Per review, for Leia Meza on DOS 02/25/2025. Reason there is a $30 balance is due to pt deductible. 

Per FA, pt portion $0 pertaining to D0220. Per EOB, pt portion $18. Therefore, $18 balance.

Per FA, pt portion $0 pertaining to D0272. Per EOB, pt portion $32 but patient paid $20. Therefore, $12 balance.
