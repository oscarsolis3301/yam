## Description

Laptop CSP3-OT1, IP address 10.51.79.220 keep loosing the ability to view X-rays from Epic. When I click on DTX clinic, nothing happens. When I click on MiPACs externally, it tells me I've launched it in stand-alone mode. This seems to happen every couple of days. What can I do?

Hello James. Thank you for your help! This morning I was able to open X-rays from Epic. Yay! 




I'm not sure what changed. I tried restarting the computer yesterday, but it didn't change anything. Maybe it just needed to think about its life choices over night.




I appreciate your help.

Hi Jantzen,

The issue should be resolved at this point. Can you verify that you can open X-rays in Epic?

Thanks,
