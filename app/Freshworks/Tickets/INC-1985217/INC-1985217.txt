Hi Crystal,

Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1985217.

you're on the right track here,

1: Please create two separate visits: 
one for the ortho codes and one for the bone graft/extraction.
2: ensure the ortho visit is on the Ortho Guarantor account.
3: Then follow any additional steps to create the charging plan. 

I have attached the SRG/tip sheets to review for these these workflows. 

thank you!
