As per review insurance is 12 months treatment and found payment received only for the banding and plan benefit has met. But insurance is monthly payor and while checking on the web and DE Â found ortho max is $2000 and not get any information regarding the ortho max met. Previously user moved to ics inquiry but not received response. Hence created ics trace ticket to verify whether the ortho max is met with same or different provider and is there any prior treatment for the patient.
