Hi Kasey,
   please let me know about the address. It seems one came back and they will be expiring soon. So I will go ahead and place
a stop and resubmit for new checks. However i cannot send them until i know that the above address is the same as "address on file"

Hi Kasey,
     I will check our returns first. If not here then I can send a check status to the bank. 
did the patient confirm this address as being correct?
