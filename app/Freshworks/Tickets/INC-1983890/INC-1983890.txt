Hi Claudia,

There
was a temp fee outage. Fees have since been fixed and verified in epic and now
populating as of this morning.

There
is a gap in the reimbursement contract from 07/27/2025 to 07/29/2025 so the
office will need to manually coordinate PT fees for any DOS in this time fame. Since DOS is for 07/31/2025 the office can create a new FA for the fees to populate.

For
further questions or concerns, please let us know.

Thank
You.
Josie

Hi Claudia,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1983890.

On review FA# 873659779 for DOS 07/29/2025 plan Deltacare HMO - Dental / C73 attached as Primary coverage and fees link not attached and showing only dashes. Verified Fee System plan C73 is already available in Fee System. Verified EPIC Reimbursement Contract Upload Page found that Fee contract for plan C73 termed on 07/27/2025 and restarted on 07/29/2025. Hence routing to Jocelyn Scott for further review. Please manually override the fee schedule and minimum guar available in Fee Finder. 

Thank you
