## Description

I KEEP GETTING ISSUE THAT IS MY ACCOUNT IS LOCKED BECAUSE of too many authentication attempts? '

Which doesn't make sense, because sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. 
it's too inconsistent and it interferes constantly with my ability to do work!
Please fix so I don't keep getting this error.

(note this happens whenever i login as first thing in the day).
