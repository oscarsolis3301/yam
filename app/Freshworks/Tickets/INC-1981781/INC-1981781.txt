Hi Angappan,

On review FA#856712093 the plan United Healthcare / Dental Benefit Providers PPO as primary coverage for DOS 07/10/2025 code D2392 was populating correctly. Checked in DE form the benefits are matching with EOB for the code D2392. in EOB the code D2392 was allowed less with remark code 45, checked in CG the billing provider is OON with DBP and UHC hence resolving this ticket and please reach out to insurance for further review. Thank you
