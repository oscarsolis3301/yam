## Description


I set up MFA for the new PDS Health Okta, but I’ve noticed that the Okta dashboard only displays a limited number of app tiles compared to what I’m used to seeing.

I wanted to check if this is expected behavior. Will the remaining tiles appear tomorrow (August 1st), or is there something I’m missing?
I also tried adding tiles manually, but some of them are not available for addition.

Thank you!
