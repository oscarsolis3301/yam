Hello!
 
Yes, I do not work at that office, but I am subbing in for the new OM. It is attached but now it shows that there are two plans. I can not fix this or it will show an error.

Hi Kenyi,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1987888.



I was unsuccessful at trying to reach you as I was told you did not work at Office 1046. However, please let me know if you are still having issues linking the patient's Wellfit plan on Epic.

To quickly assist you with resolving this issue, please contact me at the IT Service Desk at 714-845-8895.


Thank you.
