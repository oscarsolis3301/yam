## Description

hello,
I am having an issue with the following patients insurance.
Dental eligibility is not showing the form after it has been submitted. Creating another form causes an error saying that there is duplicate coverage but it cant be accessed. It is not visible in past coverage either. 
I have tried deleting everything through epic as well with no success. 
Need help creating the coverage or deleting all existing coverage so it can be restarted please.
