On review found fees populating correctly for codes D0140, D9222, D9223, D7240 and also found 50.00 Individual deductible in FA#640477220 and EOB. Patient has primary coverage United Concordia / Advantage Plus fees link attached UNITED CONCORDIA - ADVANTAGE PLUS - Advantage Plus AZ Reg 61. As per credentialing grid billing provider status active for DOS. As per Epic EOB review  claim was processed using the old Advantage Plus fee schedule, And also found Code D0140 denied with reason code 119 Benefit maximum for this time period or occurrence has been reached. No call notes in Epic, So please reach to insurance for more clarifications on this reason code. United Concordia is still updating their systems to the new negotiated rates and this code was processed based on the Reg - 61 2023 previous fees schedule by mistake, Need to resubmit the claim so that office can receive proper payment for the claim and reprocess with updated fee schedule. When we review the DE form found plan UNITED CONCORDIA PPO [865], ADVANTAGE PLUS with status N/A and also found for the most of the codes benefits are blank. Hence routed to eligibility for benefit verification. Please let me know for any additional questions. Thank You
