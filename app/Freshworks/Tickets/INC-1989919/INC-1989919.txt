Hi Anusuya,


On review FA#863213348 found plan Alwayscare Unum PPO / Care Platinum Series PPO/POS attached as primary coverage for the DOS 07/16/2025 code D2740 was populating correctly with deductible $50.00 and alternate benefit provision applied. Verified EOB found the code D2740 was allowed less than the expected amount without any specific reason with deductible $50.00. Upon reviewing the allowed amount matching with DNoA PPO for the code D2740. Checked in CG billing provider is active with CAREINGTON. Hence routing this ticket to eligibility team for plan verification. Thank youPlease find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1989919.
