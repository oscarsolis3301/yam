## Description

Can the office please get assistance in auditing this account. Patient has EOB's from DOS 05/22/25-04/16/25-11/2/23 that he is questioning, he should be due refunds due to overpayment. Office did not expect due to age limitation with Aetna HMO, Insurance did pay and the office has already issued two refunds in the total amount of $759 so far. Dad is now "demanding" the amount of the total refund to be $1354. I don't see where the office owes him that additional amount of $595 that he states according to the fee schedule we owe him. There are no current credits on the guarantor account G#8364627. Can you please review and let me know if the office is missing something. I appreciate your help in this matter, thank you.Â
