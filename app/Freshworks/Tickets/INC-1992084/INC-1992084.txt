Dear Dr. Alsad,
 
We have approved your request to join our network at the following location.
 
6660 Biscayne Blvd  Miami FL 33138
 

Congratulations and thank you for becoming a member of Guardian’s DentalGuard Network, a leader in the dental industry!  Your
 effective date is 2/25/2025.  On behalf of Guardian and its subsidiaries we extend a warm welcome to you and your dental office staff and have prepared a
Welcome Kit
 that you can utilize to hit the ground running.  This Welcome Kit contains a number of different resources including “getting started” links, materials you can use to promote that you are now accepting Guardian, and answers to our most frequently asked questions.

 
As a valued partner, you have agreed to participate in the recredentialing program and continue to adhere to the same criteria
 and professional standards you are currently demonstrating.  Recredentialing will occur every 36 months and you will hear from us in approximately 30 months to begin the recredentialing cycle.
 

Your name and office information will be added to our DentalGuard Network directory at
www.GuardianLife.com. 
 Members are encouraged to visit participating dentists to reduce their out-of-pocket expenses, as many Guardian plan designs provide enhanced benefits with higher maximums, lower co-insurance percentages and waived deductibles when a network dentist is

utilized.



Guardian is contracted with Change Healthcare to provide Electronic Fund Transfer (EFT) which can dramatically reduce
 administration expenses, shorten the reimbursement cycle and streamline processes.  You can sign up at
https://support.changehealthcare.com/customer-resources/enrollment-services
 or call 1-866-506-2830.


 

If you have contracted to participate in a Medicare or Medicaid program, you may only see patients covered by these programs
 once you have obtained your Medicare and/or Medicaid identification number.  Georgia providers who elect to participate in a Medicaid Managed Care program
 must be credentialed by this State prior to seeing patients; Guardian does not perform the credentialing for Georgia Medicaid programs.  Upon completion of the system setup, you will receive your Provider Identification Number (PIN) and instructions to file
 claims for services rendered on or after your effective date.

 


Manage benefit administration and obtain your fee schedule online! Visit 
www.GuardianLife.com 
 and use your provider ID (above) to log on.  Click on “Register Now”, choose “Healthcare Professional” and “Agree to the Healthcare Professional Agreement”
 to create your account. You can verify eligibility, check claims status, sign up for direct deposit and much more!                                                 
          Sign up today!!!


 
If your state has non-Covered Services legislation and you have opted to allow discounts on non-covered services by voluntarily
 accepting the Opt-In Provision, fee schedule amounts will apply to all non-covered services for covered individuals.   This will apply to all office locations at which you participate in our network. 

 
We look forward to enjoying a lasting relationship with you and your dental office.  Guardian values the commitment you have
 made in joining the DentalGuard network; together, we can improve the oral health of members within your community! 

 
Sincerely,
Guardian Dental Network Services
 
 

Guardian performs credentialing for its DentalGuard Network.  Providers participating in the DentalGuard
 Network through a leased arrangement are credentialled by the leased entity.  Guardian® is a registered service mark of The Guardian Life Insurance Company of America, New York, New York. ©2020 Guardian. All rights reserved.
