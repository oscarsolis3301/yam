Hi Adnan,

I hope you're doing well.

We are unable to transfer SmartPay arrangements between guarantor accounts. Currently, two active arrangements exist under guarantor ID #13168227 (Tiku Kiflegiorgis). Therefore, your office will need to close the SmartPay arrangement for guarantor ID #13171183 (Alganesh Belete) and set up a new SmartPay arrangement under her guarantor ID.

Additionally, any credits associated with guarantor ID #13168227 will need to be transferred to guarantor ID #13171183.

Please let us know if you need further assistance.

Thank you,
Best regardsStephanie Henry
