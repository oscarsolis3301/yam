## Description

need to work for the credits so check for HMO credit calc available doc of Aetna HMO Plans 2025 but there is no copay amount for the ortho codes. Hence moved to ICS to verify the copay and allowed amount of D8080, D8670 and D8680 and records, there is no available WQ so created a trace ticket
