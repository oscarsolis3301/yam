Claim submitted to CIGNA PPO.As per previous note claim was resubmitted.  Called CIGNA PPO @ 800-882-4462. Rep stated no claim on file and search with patient name and DOB. But still unable to pull claim status on the DOS. So for more precise checked all the demographic details of patient with the spelling as well. As per rep all info found to be correct except the patient address. As per rep patient has two coverages. Under the PPO plan the address is different. Checked in EPIC found two coverages
under HMO and PPO. The subscribers are different, both plan are under the parents. In analysis found the DIQ form in clinical docs, it states that patient stays with mother. According to that correct address is  2083 HENRIETTA DR FORNEY, TX 75126. So there is no need to change the address and previously moved to RI wq and rcvd response as same. No rejections from their side and suggest to submit the claim. Claim was resubmitted multiple times and not rcvd to the payor.  Hence routing the claim to ncof
wq
