On review found fees populating correctly for code D4261 in FA#730629444. Benefits updated after record was finalized. Replace to update amounts. Patient has primary Meritain Health PPO - Dental / Aetna Dental PPO same fees link attached. As per credentialing grid billing provider status is active for DOS. Verified dental eligibility found MERITAIN HEALTH PPO [669], AETNA DENTAL PPO with status Completed - ROC and found comments PPO- EMP FS= PT COPAY. Verified attached EOB for code D4261  paid less than the estimate amount with no specific reason codes and applied 125.00 as copay. So please reach out to patient and get the Employer Fee schedule, Hence resolving this ticket, please let me know for any additional questions. Thank you
