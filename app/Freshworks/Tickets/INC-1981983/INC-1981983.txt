Hi Umesh Mani

Thank you for reaching out to Patient Benefits. 

We have completed and updated the DE form to reflect the most current benefit information.


Unfortunately, the patient has maxed out their dental benefits and would not be eligible for services until the next benefit period.



Kindly,
Patient Benefits Service Desk
