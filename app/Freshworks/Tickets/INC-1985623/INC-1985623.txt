Hi Raya,

Okay, question actually.. When we charge out the restart do we attach the fee?

Hi Raya,

Please review account ensuring steps below were followed regarding account reinstation:

Regarding MRN#  21150321 Ryan Rhudy

 When a patient who has been financially dismissed returns to the office to continue the orthodontic treatment, follow the steps on the attached SRG to restart the insurance payment and patient contract. No help ticket will be needed in these cases. Once ORTHODONTIC TREATMENT RESTART is charged out and a new FA is provided, the account will be reviewed and Dental Billing Plan will be established and any necessary claim will be created via the overnight system and placed into the billing WQ for submission.
