## Description

Hello, I received a call from lisa from bcbs of ma and she stated dr tian zhu is showing inactive because her address with bcbs of az is the old watson road one. The correct one is 825 S watson road suite 101 buckeye az 85326. 
She said we have to give bcbs of az to update the address and then bcbs of ma can reprocess the claim. May you please assist? Thank you.
