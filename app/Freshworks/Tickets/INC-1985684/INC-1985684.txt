Hi Timothy,

Is this where you are attempting to add the provider? 


If so, I don't believe you need to select the location when selecting the provider because the department is selected in the box above the billing provider. 

I am going to send this over to billing for confirmation, but can you confirm that this is where you are trying to add the provider? 

Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1985684.

Thanks, 
Mandie

Hi Timothy,
Could you please take a screenshot of the screen where you are attempting to add the provider and then where you are clicking to search for the provider? Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1985684.

Hi Timothy,
I've reviewed the provider's record and everything looks good on my end.  Could you please provide a full screenshot of Epic?  When I search for this provider, I have the option to show more addresses.  I see your location as an option once I expand and scroll down.  Do you not have this option? 





If you do not have the same list, have you tried removing the address in the upper section, clearing the filters and searching only by the provider's name? 

Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1985684.

Thanks, 
Mandie
