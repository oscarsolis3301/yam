Hi There, 




I have been looped into this email as of today and with urgency I have looped in the appropriate department to get this resolved as soon as possible. 




Is there any additional information I may be able to provide for our team? Looks like the email is stating overpayment, I see the insurance covered the services based off what insurance breakdown we had on file. Is there an explanation for the alleged overpayment? 




Thank you for your assistance in this matter,
