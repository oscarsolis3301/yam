## Description

need to work for the credits calc we have an available doc of Blue Shield of CA DHMO Plans 2024 but there is no copay amount of or plan of Blue Shield of CA HMO / Enhanced Ifp Supp Fam Scfg274. Hence moved to ICS to verify the copay amount of D8080, D8670 and D8680 and records, there is no available WQ so created a trace ticket
