## Description

The AV Room PC at San Diego Training center was recently replaced by Sayan. They need files pulled off from the old PC and placed into the new one. Sayan has the old PC and will be leaving it on his rack in the asset room with a tag.Â Please pull files from Desktop and Documents folder. I will provide further instructions on how we will transfer them over to the new PC.
