## Description

As per account review INS expect is $0.00 but the DBP was rolled for $0.01 with description of "unbilled" and INS paid from banding till 05/25 with no missing payments since INS over paid we need to check HMO credit calculator but checked fee / document finder but available Fee schedule document doesn't have ortho codes in it, Therefore previous user created ICS trace ticket under # 1939956 to know the correct fee schedule document for our plan 8, and we have got response on
"Upon checking EOB in OnBase for Aetna HMO found that the allowed amount for banding claim for D8080 is $800.00 and copay for D8080 is $400.00, allowed amount for D8670 is $100.00 and copay for D8670 is $50.00 for each month. There is no allowed and copay for records D0330, D0340, D0350, D0470 as the records claim was denied as mentioning procedure code incidental to primary procedure as separate payment will not be made for records as records are paid along with banding and no separate payment will be made. Claim # EFFDFDL0T0000. For proc code D8680 the there is no allowed amount and copay as deband was not yet charged and patient is still under ongoing treatment". So we need a Exact fee schedule for the plan 8, Or we need a clear information for the for the Code D8680,Â
