Hi Sachin,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1987067.

On review FA #863092389 found plan Guardian PPO - Dental / Dentalguard Preferred attached as primary coverage and fees are populating correctly as per FA. Verified DE form found plan GUARDIAN PPO [549], DENTALGUARD PREFERRED with status Verified by Front Office. Verified Epic EOB found for code D2740 &amp; D2950 has been processed using old fee schedule "Guardian PDS CA 3 GP &amp; SP" fee schedule. Need to resubmit the claim so that office can receive proper payment for the claim and reprocess with updated fee schedule, Plan attachment and fee schedule have been verified to be correct. Insurance is using an old fee schedule. Hence resolving this ticket.


Thank you!
