Hi Kasturi,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1984774.

On review found fees populating correctly for code D2950 in FA#857871061. Patient has primary coverage Delta Dental of CA PPO - Dental / Delta Preferred same fees link attached. Verified dental eligibility found plan DELTA DENTAL OF CA PPO [437], DELTA PREFERRED with status N/A.  When we review the EOB for code D2950 claim processed with correct allowed amount as per estimate but paid 87.00 by insurance with 50.00 copay patient responsibility. As per DE form for code D2950 benefits not updated blank. Verified Credentialing status found Billing Provider status is INN. In DE form for most of the codes benefits not updated blank. Hence routed to Eligibility for benefit re-verification. Please let me know for any additional questions, Thank you
