## Description

I am showing the Anthem BCBS of CA made one payment of $500. The additional payment in the guarantor account looks to be a duplicate. Anthem of MN Federal is still paying on the claim. The unsecured amount for the account should be $500. However, the unsecured amount is showing to be $946.17. Please verify correct unsecured balance. Thank you.Â
