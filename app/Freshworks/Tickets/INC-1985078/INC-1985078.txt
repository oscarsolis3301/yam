Okay so now I believe my access is fixed, however I think Kevin, the other digital fellow that is also having issues also needs his Okta verification reset like mine was. Get Outlook for iOS

Hi there, I reset my Okta account and password and re-did my okta verify however I still do not have EPIC access and cannot login. Kind Regards, Dr. Joyce Hunsaker, DDS | Digital Dentistry Fellow Workman School of Dental Medicine – HPU Health

Thank you for contacting the Service Desk. I attempted to contact you via phone to no avail.

We are looking further into the Epic issue. However, I did see "invalid username and password" messages in Okta - the app that manages your parallels login. 
Can you try logging into pacificdental.okta.com and let me know if it is working? if not we can attempt a password reset.
