## Description

Hello, 
This patient's insurance is denying covering extractions due to insurance letting office know that claim for immediate dentures was sent stating teeth were already extracted. Teeth were not extracted at this point. Dr. ton added addendum to his note for this day. can we please make insurance aware of this info to try to get extractions claim paid? 


Thank you
