Hi Cynthia,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1988945.

On review FA# 846916202 for DOS 06/25/2025 plan Deltacare HMO - Dental / C97 attached as primary coverage and fees are populating as per the fee schedule for code D6740. Verified Fee schedule found that the additional $400 is from the Supplemental pays. Hence routing to Jocelyn Scott for further review with the Supplemental plan pay amount in Fee schedule. 

Thank you
