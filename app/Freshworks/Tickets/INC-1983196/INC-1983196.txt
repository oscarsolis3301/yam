## Description

Jacqueline called because the office just got their add provider request granted for Maria Yeaton. However, there are appointments that currently exist under Dr. Ho. Dr. Yeaton will be taking over these appointments. So, she wanted to know what is the best way to go about removing Dr. Ho's columns, replacing them with Dr. Yeaton's columns, but having all of the appointments that exist under Dr. Ho end up under Dr. Yeaton.
