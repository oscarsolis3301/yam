Hi Mohammed,

On review FA#865673192 the plan Guardian PPO - Dental / Dentalguard Preferred as primary coverage for DOS 07/19/2025 code D9223 was populating correctly. Checked in DE form the benefits are matching with EOB for the code D9223 but for code 6 &amp; 7series are blank in Gp, verified in EOB the code D9223 was paid together and was allowed as per the fee schedule. Checked in CG the provider is active for the DOS hence routing this ticket to eligibility team for benefit update for blank codes . Thank you
