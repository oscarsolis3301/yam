Hi Pravin,


On review FA#868859886 found plan Lincoln Financial Group PPO / UCR attached as Primary coverage for the DOS 07/23/2025 D4346 with deductibles $50.00. Verified EOB insurance allowed and paid less amount than the FA without any specific reason for code D4346. Payer has different UCR than PDS &amp; office needs to manually coordinate with carrier to sort carrier payment, Checked in CG billing provider is not found and considered as Provider OON.
