On review FA# 856459567 for DOS 07/09/2025 plan Aetna HMO - Dental / Plan Li attached as Primary coverage and fees are populating and showing Benefits updated after record was finalized. Replace to update amounts. Verified EOB, On further review the Plan Li copay pays 40% for D7230 with Aetna Dental PPO SP fee schedule, the copay fee is $281 x 40% = $112.4. But insurance paid 40% of the Min guar (example: $220x 40% = $88). Hence resolving this ticket, Please refile the claim to get correct payment and please reach out to insurance for further information. Thank You
