Hi Udayakumar,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1982014.



On review found fees populating correctly for codes D2391, D2392 in FA#865520380, Patient has primary coverage United Concordia / Advantage Plus fees link attached UNITED CONCORDIA - ADVANTAGE PLUS - ADVANTAGE PLUS NOCAL REG 8. Verified dental eligibility found UNITED CONCORDIA PPO [865], ADVANTAGE PLUS with status Verified by Auto Eligibility. When we review the EOB claim not processed based on the Advantage Plus PPO fees allowed amount not matched and also 50.00 deductible applied to code D2392. In FA deductible applied to code D2330. As per credentialing grid billing provider status is active for DOS. Hence routed to eligibility to re-verify the eligibility and attach the correct plan to patient coverage &amp; FA. Please let me know for any additional questions. Thank You
