Hi Colette,

Thanks
for reaching out to us!
 
 We have verified a temp fee outage. Fees are
being fixed. In the interim, office should utilize fee finder to manually
coordinate pt fees for upcoming appointments.
 
I
will update &amp; resolve your ticket once fees have been verified in epic.
 
Thank
You.

Hi Colette,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1986763.

On review FA# 875549223 for DOS 07/30/2025 plan Blue Cross Blue Shield of IL PPO / Dnoa PPO attached as Primary coverage and fees link not attached showing only dashes. Verified EPIC Plan Reimbursement Contract Upload page Fee contract termed on 07/23/2025 and unable to upload. Please manually override the FA with the fee schedule available in Fee Finder. Hence routing to Jocelyn Scott for further review. 

Thank you

Thank you so much for the guidance on the plan mismatch in DE and Epic.  I called and verified that the correct plan is DNOA PPO.  I was able to updated that in the patient's registration, but fees are still not populating.  I was able to get the needed fees
 for planned treatment, but we still need to get a fee schedule attached to query previous and upcoming visits.




Thank you for your help.

Colette

Hi Colette,

looks like the wrong plan is attached. BCBS - DNOA PPO is on DE but BCBS - CARE SERIES PPO/POS is on reg, you'll need to delete/update one or the other.
