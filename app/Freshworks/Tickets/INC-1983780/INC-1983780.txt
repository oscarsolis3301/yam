07/23 Tech notes: Arrived on site

 

I was greeted by front desk staff and directed to enter towards the back. As I walked through the hallway I met Karla, she led me to X-ray room and explained that the sensor was not coming up on their DTX Studio. I called PDS IT Support, spoke with Nathan. I explained the issue and he logged into the workstation remotely. After a few minutes of checking settings, rebooting the workstation, unplugging / replugging the sensor and verifying if the sensor was being recognized by DTX, he got it working. I asked Karla to check if it was working properly. Now working properly.
