Hi Kaja,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1982133.




On review FA #806938437 found plan Aetna Medicare - Dental / Ucr - Po Box 981106 attached as primary coverage and fees link attached. Verified dental eligibility found AETNA MEDICARE [237], UCR - PO BOX 981106 with status ROC Request Pending. When we review the Epic EOB claim processed based on Plan Aetna Dental PPO fees using "Aetna PPO 941 GP 2025" fee schedule and for code D4910 claim was denied with reason code #N10: Payment based on the findings of a review organization/professional consult/manual adjudication/medical advisor/dental advisor/peer review. As per credentialing grid billing provider status active for DOS. Hence routing to eligibility for plan verification and attach the correct plan to patient coverage &amp; FA.


Thank you!
