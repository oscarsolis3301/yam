On review FA#855623466 Found plan Renaissance Dental PPO / Diversified PPO attached as primary coverage and verified DE form found same plan is attached. Verified EOB found for code D7210 allowed amount is Paid less than estimate and fees are not matching with FA and with fee system. D7210 #2Deductible applied in FA and in EOB. Hence routing to eligibility for plan verification. Please route back to ROC FEES for further review. Thank You
