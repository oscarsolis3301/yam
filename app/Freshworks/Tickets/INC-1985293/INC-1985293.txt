Thank you so much! The patient is adamant she did not receive a check. By chance, do you have the check number and the date it was cashed?

Hi mylinda.clark,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1985293.
the patient has a true balance, the payment of 600.00 has been refunded twice, one a in a check and has been cashed, however there was also a refund done back to card.
Therefore the 600.00 is due by patient.

Thank you

Hi mylinda.clark,
   ok, I will send this over to 
@Cristal Yamachi
 

Cristal,
    Can you review this account. I have confirmed that the check was cashed. ROC has confirmed that the refund was done on 6/17 to a credit
card also. So I dont know if this should have a balance or is it correct now.
please let office know

Hello, thank you for the update. There will need to be an adjustment, the patient has a bill, and she's upset over it. Can patient payment solutions team look into it? I appreciate all your help!

Hi mylinda.clark,
   So this is what happened. It seems that the code 6009 GUARANTOR REFUND. Can either be a credit card or a check.
Due the fact that the transaction was linked to a credit card, if requesting a check, it must be changed on the request.
I am not 100% sure what needs to be changed.

I assume this one did not auto process to the card, because it was in process for the check. Checks take two days to fully process.
so when someone looked into this and saw it had not been processed, they manually processed to the credit card.
Apologies, it has been refunded twice. At this point I dont know if there needs to be any adjustments? Let me know if this
balance is not right and we can send this over to patient payment solutions team.

Hi mylinda.clark,
     I will investigate this further.. the refund posted on 6/26/25 was posted with a code (8997) which normally is used to balance a reconciliation issue. No refund is actually
processed. I will circle back with you once have the full info on that adjustment.
Thanks
SM

Hi mylinda.clark,

Of course, let me reassign the ticket to our Accounting Dept to follow up on the check. Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1985293.

Thank you for the update. The patient stated she did not receive two checks, only one. Is there a way to track the check from 06/26/25?
