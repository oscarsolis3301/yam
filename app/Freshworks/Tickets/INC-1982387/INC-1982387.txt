Hi Gajalakshmi,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1982387.



On review FA#864190921 found plan Unitedhealth Group PPO - Dental / Dental Benefit Providers PPO attached as primary coverage, Fees populates in FA. Verified DE form found same plan is attached. Verified EOB found Code D7210 allowed amount in EOB is incorrect which is less than FA fees. For code D7210 amount used for calculation is matching with GP fee type with no specific reason code. In registration found that treatment provided was based on OS and confirmed with credentialling billing found the Billing Provider is registered as OS dentist and provider status is In Process considering as OON for DOS, billing provider is not active for the DOS 07/17/2025 mentioned in Ticket. The Billing Provider is a Specialty but OON with the Payer and OD is GP (General) INN with the payer, So insurance processed the claim as per the OD type. Hence resolving this Ticket. So please manually override the FA to match with the EOB and Please reach out to insurance for further information. Thank You
