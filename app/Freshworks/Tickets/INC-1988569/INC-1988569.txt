## Description


Hello,

For the past few months, the backspace key on my laptop has been giving me problems. Often, I have to press it several times before it responds. However, as of today, it has stopped working entirely.

I was hoping to check if thereâ€™s anything you can do on your end to help, or if this is likely a hardware issue with the key itself.

Thank you very much!

Best regards,

JG
