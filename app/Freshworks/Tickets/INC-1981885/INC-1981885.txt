## Description

However pri ins payment for dos 7/23 of $49.37 is posted twice under same check #824022000159181. Already created trace ticket under INC-#1836602 to validate the payment and received response in call notes dated 5/13/2025 stating "Rep stated for 5/23-7/23 the correct payment they have issued is-$148.11 via eft#823206000428873 Â under claim#PNPC3F6S00 and this payment sent to the provider Nitin Malhotra. And inquired the payment of $49.37 via eft#824022000159181 under claim#EXJM8RN6K01. Rep stated this payment 6/23-7/23 and the payment sent to Serge Mechrek. So rep stated that the payment for the month of june and july 2023 for-$98.74 should be refunded that was issued under the provider NITIN . So rep sent a request to their processor to send a overpayment letter to the office. Tat is 7-10 business days". The reprocess TAT is satisfied but overpayment letter is not processed yet. Hence creating trace ticket to know the reprocess status.
