## Description

This claim dropped into the Claim Edit WQ. As of 07/14/2025, the claim was removed from the Claim Edit WQ but it looks like it has not been rebilled to the carrier. I called the carrier (Lineco) and spoke with rep Charity (ref# IV2521132133) who said they received part of the claim for this DOS. They have the Crown and BU (Invoice# A97210306370) which was paid but they did not receive the claim for the Root canal (invoice# A97210306360). Can we get this claim prioritized and billed to the carrier ASAP?!
