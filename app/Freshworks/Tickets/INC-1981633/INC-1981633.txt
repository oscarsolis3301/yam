Hi Michaela Rodriguez

Thank you for reaching out to Patient Benefits. 
We have updated the dental eligibility form to reflect the most current benefit information. 
Please note, if you notice the coverage does not appear to be attached in the registration, please take the following steps to attach the coverage: 



 Open the Coverage Wizard, by using the “Add Coverage” link located in the top right-hand corner of the Guarantors &amp; Coverages section in the registration view. 
Once in the Coverage Wizard, there will be Coverages located under the search bar. 
Select the coverage that needs to be attached. 
To complete the process, click on the “Finish” button at the bottom left of the screen. 
It is also important to ensure the coverage is attached to the “Visit Info”

Hi Michaela,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1981633.


On review Dental Eligibility found HUMANA HMO [1220], ADVANTAGE AVM1 with status Completed - ROC and notes: No fees are attached to this plan: Please confirm the correct plan is selected above. Verified Fee System plan Advantage AVM1 is not available and Humana PPO is INN with OD. Hence routing to Eligibility for plan re-verification. 


Thank you
