Hi Nanthini,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1984596.

On review found fees populating correctly for code D3330 in FA#866013433. Patient has primary coverage United Concordia PPO - Dental / Advantage Plus fees link attached UNITED CONCORDIA - ADVANTAGE PLUS - Advantage Plus CO Reg 43. Verified dental eligibility found UNITED CONCORDIA PPO [865], ADVANTAGE PLUS with status Completed - ROC. As per credentialing grid billing provider status is active for DOS. When we review the EOB claim not processed based on the  Advantage Plus PPO fees. Hence routed to eligibility to re-verify the eligibility and attach the correct plan to patient coverage &amp; FA. Please let me know for any additional questions. Thank You
