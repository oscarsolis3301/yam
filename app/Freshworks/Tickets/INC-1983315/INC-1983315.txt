Hi Julianne,

Asset Management's IT Orders is now using FMS.  Please approve or reject the purchase of 1x HP AIO w Stand, KM, &amp; Cables for the Consult room when you receive the PO email notice.  If not approved or rejected within 48 hours, the PO will automatically escalate to your RM.  Thanks for your help.
