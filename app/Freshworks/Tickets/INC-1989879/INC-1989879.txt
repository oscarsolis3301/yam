Hi Muthu,


On review FA#871285018 found plan Delta Dental of AR PPO - Dental / Delta Premier attached as primary coverage for the DOS 07/25/2025 code D4341 was populating correctly with deductibles $75.00. Verified EOB found the code D4341 was allowed less than the expected amount without any specific reason. Upon reviewing the allowed amount matching with Delta Preferredfor the code D4341. Checked in CG billing provider is active with Delta Dental.Hence routing this ticket to eligibility team for plan verification.
