Hi Ponraj,
Please disregard the previous comments:

On review FA#797453178 the plan Ameritas PPO - Dental / Ameritas PPO as secondary coverage for DOS 01/23/2025 code D6010 was populating correctly. Checked in DE form the benefits are matching with EOB for the code D6010. Verified in EOB the code D6010 was paid less than the expected amount with remark code 45. Checked in CG the billing provider Brendan Schleyer (Perio) is active for the DOS. Verified Perio Fee schedule found that the insurance allowed correct amount as per the Provider type. Hence resolving this ticket. Please manually override the FA to match EOB or please reach out to insurance for further information. Thank you
