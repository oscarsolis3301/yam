Hi Bitsiet,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1990214.




Thank you for your request.

Epic remote access has been granted, and will be accessible within 60-90 minutes.Â 

To access Epic remotely please go to https://connect.pdshealth.com/ and enter your PDS credentials. If you are not on the PDS network (ie. not in a dental office, or support office), you will be prompted for MFA. On the left side, you will see the "Apps" tab - click on it to expand. Click on "All apps" , and then select "Epic access" from the list of apps that will be presented on the right side. You will be prompted to enter your PDS credentials once more, in the Citrix Gateway prompt.

Upon entering the credentials successfully, you will see all Epic icons you have access to, and you will be able to select the one you want to login to.

Attached is the QRG providing you the step by step guide on how to access Epic remotely - please select the one that applies to your case - Windows or Mac computer.


Best regards,
