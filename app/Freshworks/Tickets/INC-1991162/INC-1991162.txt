Thank you for your request. 

Please ensure that you are trying to access your Outlook via the NEW Okta tenant - https://pdshealth.okta.com/. 

If this is your first time using the new site, you’ll be asked to set up multi-factor authentication (MFA) — a quick extra security step to help protect your account. For help, check out the attached Quick Reference Guide (QRG) with step-by-step instructions.

Here are a few helpful reminders:

Your credentials (username and password) haven’t changed.
Be sure you've completed registration and MFA setup in the new tenant.
