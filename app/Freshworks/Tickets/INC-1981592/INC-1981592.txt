Hi Atocha,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1981592.




Thank you for reaching out to Patient Benefits. Unfortunately, we are unable to verify the benefits.


Please see below for resolution details:
• We have reached out to the carrier; however, our reps were denied benefits.
• The reason given by the carrier is that they do not provide information to 3rd party
administrators.

Next Steps:
• The benefit verification now becomes the office’s responsibility to complete.
We do apologize for the inconvenience.

Kindly,
