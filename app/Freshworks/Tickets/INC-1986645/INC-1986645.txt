## Description

When trying to mill a katana One block, there is always an error that populates that states either the left instrument is incorrect or defective. We have to restart the MC X and the primescan several times and try again until the error message says that there is no quality block label detected, at which point the system will allow us to push it forward to mill the crown.&nbsp;
