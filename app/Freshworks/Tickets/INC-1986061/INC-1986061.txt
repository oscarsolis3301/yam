## Description

Hi team,
477_10517444_801031268
This account was in the offices charge review. We have updated dos 4/1/25 to include the D8090, Inital GP Aligner delivery and Invisalign Lab/Upgrade fee. However, the DBP and PCP were already created and the account is now reflecting an untrue balance $940. Please review and advise if this will be adjusted/fall off in the over night process or let me know if I need to update the FA with $0 for these services because the DBP/PCP were already created and account should be PIF.
Thank you,
KatieÂ
