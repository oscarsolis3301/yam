On review FA #842695175 found plan  Aetna PPO - Dental / Aetna Dental PPO attached as primary coverage and deductible charged. Verified DE form found plan AETNA PPO [238], AETNA DENTAL PPO with status Completed - ROC. Verified epic paper EOB found for first code D4341 denied with reason code #1;These service codes reflect the submitted codes. The service codes directly below the shaded lines indicate the service codes utilized for payment based upon our claim policies and rules. and for the other D4341 code having alternate benefit provision for code D4342 and deductible charged with reason code #4;Based upon review of the documentation, it appears there is a more appropriate ADA/CDT code for this service. This benefit determination reflects that code. No call notes available. Please reach to insurance more clarification. Hence resolving this ticket.
