Good afternoon!
While doing system maintenance I noticed Dr. SARA KARIM does not have the correct fee schedule at location- 7375 BOYNTON BEACH BLVD BOYNTON BEACH, FL 33437. To correct this, we have two options-
1.            Add the correct fee schedule with an effective date of 07/26/2025 and reprocess claims. The office would be responsible for any possible over/under payments as a result of reprocessing.
2.            Add the correct fee schedule with a future effective date, no claims impact.

Feel free to give me a call with any questions you may have!
 
 
Thank You!

Good Morning!
 
I do not have an MRN# or Invoice NO#. I am doing maintenance within in our system and noticed an update was not made correctly for the Fee schedule for Dr. Sara Karim. In order to fix the issue I can do one
 of the two options stated in my original email. 
1.            Add the correct fee schedule with an effective date of 07/26/2025 and reprocess claims. The office would be responsible for any possible over/under payments as a result of reprocessing.
2.            Add the correct fee schedule with a future effective date, no claims impact.
 
I appreciate your time and patience in this matter.
