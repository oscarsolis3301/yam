Hi Jennifer,

I hope this email finds you well.

The patient's July 28, 2025 Wellfit arrangement payment has reduced the Smartpay balance from $2,710.38 to $2,439.34. This balance also matches the Self-Pay balance in Epic.

Thank you. Please let us know if you need any further assistance.

Best regards,
Stephanie Henry
