## Description

As per review the remaining unpaid was beyond the trx length so the claim was already worked and check with ins reimbursement calc and the ins reimbursement amount is $1500, it was already created a trace ticket for verify why ins paying less and received response from trace stated that without call reference as per checked in website found the DD OF AR PPO claim was paid from banding till july 2025 as for each month the claim paid for $51.55 Â and for aug 2025 its in process, as the ltm$ 1500.00 met$ 1087.60 and mode of payment auto monthly cr 80%, so the payment will pay until the ltm met or plan termed which our comes first and the total month of treatment is 18 months and it will end by sep 2025 its not clear about. Hence again moved to ICS to verify with the actual reimbursement amount and there is no active WQ so created a trace ticket
