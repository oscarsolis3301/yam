## Description

Good morning, We had a patient present us with his CC statement showing a charge from our address in the amount of $121.75 in 06/25/2025. This charge apparently triggered a cash advance fee to the patient of $6.08, which pt. would like refunded. Please evaluate this charge and refund if indicated. Patient would like an update as to what happened and when/if the charges are reversed. Thank you for looking into this:)

Hi Whitney,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1987636.

Hello,

We do not show this transaction in our systems. This appears to be a cash transaction, like an ATM of some sorts. We advise the patient to initiate a dispute with their bank. As we do not show that we received the funds. 

Thank you

Hi- Thank you for your quick response! You are correct, I looked at payment history also and saw the payment for $59.80, however if you look at the charge on 06/25 of his credit card statement with our address attached in the amount of $121.75, this is what the patient was inquiring about.
