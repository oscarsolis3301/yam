Once in the Coverage Wizard, there will be Coverages located under the search bar. 
Select the coverage that needs to be attached.

On review FA#862068916 Found plan Delta Dental of CO PPO - Dental / Delta Premier attached as primary coverage with Benefits updated after record was finalized. Replace to update amounts and verified DE form found same plan is attached. Verified EOB found allowed amount is matching with plan Delta Preferred for code D7210 , D4261, Code D4360 is may altered to code D4261. Hence routing to eligibility for plan verification. Once verification is completed please route back to ROC FEES to further Review. thank you
