Hi Shan,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1984853.

On review FA #853341151 found plan Guardian PPO - Dental / Dentalguard Preferred attached as primary coverage but code D0274 not found for the DOS 7/17/2025 instead found D2740 fees are populating correctly as per FA. Verified DE form found plan GUARDIAN PPO [549], DENTALGUARD PREFERRED with status Verified by Front Office. Verified Epic EOB found for code D2740 has been processed using old fee schedule "Guardian PDS NV 1 GP Eff 09232020" fee schedule. Need to resubmit the claim so that office can receive proper payment for the claim and reprocess with updated fee schedule, Plan attachment and fee schedule have been verified to be correct. Insurance is using an old fee schedule. As per Ticket claim #30306H20200 and Invoice #A32410487680 matched with EOB payment for D2740 instead of D0274. So Please confirm the correct CDT code to work on this ticket.

Thank you!
