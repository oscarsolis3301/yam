Hi Anumol,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1981695.

On review found fees populating correctly for code D9310 in FA#866302195, Patient has coverage Delta Tricare Federal / Delta Preferred same fees link attached in FA, Verified dental eligibility found DELTA TRICARE FEDERAL [1292], DELTA PREFERRED with status Verified by Front Office. When we review the Epic EOB for code D9310 claim processed based on the Delta Legion PPO fees with reason code 131 Claim specific negotiated discount. As per credentialing grid billing provider status is active for DOS. Hence routed to eligibility to re-verify the eligibility and attach the correct plan to patient coverage &amp; FA. Please let me know for any additional questions. Thank You
