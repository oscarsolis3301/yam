## Description


Guarantor Account:  800892065



 Up on review also found the account was already worked and closed for Services rendered and the DBPs got already terminated and the last visit date as per Guar Docs is 10/04/2023 and then found trx restart code has been billed on 11/14/2024 for 6Months and to validate the payments received for banding DOS. We have banding on 5/23 but the ins active from 8/1/2023 as per DE and coverage tab . In website unable to pull the further details for the above mentioned scenario . So created trace ticket to know when was the correct ins active date. Need eligibility details of this case. And if the date was 8/1/2023 as mentioned in coverage tab was right then whether the payment received from dos5/23 will recoup or not.
