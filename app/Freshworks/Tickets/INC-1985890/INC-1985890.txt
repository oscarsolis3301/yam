I have tried this a few times and it seems to be hit or miss, sometimes it works sometimes it dies an doesn't restart. We were hoping to just get a third device in case another issue arises .


Kind regards,

Hi Carter,

When a replacement battery is newly inserted the payment terminal may not recognize it until it goes through a full boot up sequence. Please unplug the payment terminal and try to restart it. After it restarts, plug the USB cable back in. If it won't start up, plug it back in with the USB cable. and it should then go through the boot up sequence and recognize the new battery.



Regards,
