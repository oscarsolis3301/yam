## Description

Upon review for the sec ins for the quarter of 10/01/2024-12/01/2024 we have only one month payment of $80.30 is posted, as per review in Onbase found that we have payment of $240.90 but here in epic we have only $80.30. Hence previous user has already moved the claim to posting team but no response and payment is not posted yet, so now creating a posting ticket to post the remaining payment for the DOS 11/24 &amp; 12/24.
