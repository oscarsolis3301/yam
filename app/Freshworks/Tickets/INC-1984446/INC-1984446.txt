## Description

Earlier this year we had the left side motor went out on our brand new machine. The motor was replaced. However, we still continue to have issues with the left side. I believe the motor is going out &nbsp;again. I replaced the step bur this morning at 10am, by 230pm and two crowns later, it would not cut. I have taken a picture of the bur to show what it looks like after two mills. Previous tech that came out said it was a motor issue, not a user issue

Just to be certain, have you already tried calibrating the milling unit?


Thanks,
