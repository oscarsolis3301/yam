## Description

I submitted a ticket requesting an email/ username change to my preferred last name. After a couple of weeks, it has now reflected those changes on my end however, this has affected my access to Dataroma (Sales Force) that I use on a day-to-day basis. Anytime, I attempt to log into the system it does not allow my to sign in using my updated email address (michaela.zamora@pdshealth.com) and continues to give me an error message using my old email (hernandezzamoram). I will need this fixed by end of day today since this is preventing me from getting Q2 Marketing Reports done. Please get me Sales Force access ASAP. 

I have attached an image of what I see on my screen:
