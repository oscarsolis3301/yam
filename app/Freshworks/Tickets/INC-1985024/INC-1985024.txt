## Description

Ins exp is $0.00 and found Ins DBP was revised as $0.01 for banding 3/26/2024 with the description of """""""""""""""""""""""""""" unbilled """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""". As per review found that the insurance paid $ 1135.00 for banding and records no dnl as of now in epic. As the claim is billed as unbilled checked the reimbursement using fee schedule DeltaCare CA Benefit Book CA10A - CAS98 2024 / DeltaCare CA Ortho 2019 Min Guars and found that the reimbursement is $ 425.00 and but found that there is no payment received after the banding payment . so excluding records we have received only payment of $ 75.00 for banding after that no payment is received and no dnl is found in epic. Hence created an fee schedule ticket to verify the correct reimbursement and need to verify will they pay any payment or what is the reimbursement amount.Â
