On review Dental Eligibility found DELTACARE HMO [208], C63 with status ROC Request Pending and notes: No fees are attached to this plan: Please confirm the correct plan is selected above. Verified Fee System plan C63 is already available and verified EPIC Plan Xref found plan C63 is completed. Hence routing to Eligibility for plan re-verification.
