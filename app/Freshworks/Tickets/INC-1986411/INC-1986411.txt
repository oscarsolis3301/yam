Hi Roxana,

One of the providers will need to open the encounter and click on the Clipboard icon and click the X next to the order to remove it. For this one I went ahead and removed it but now you know for future reference that a provider at the office will be able to complete this as well. Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1986411.
