## Description

Hello,
Can you please submit appeal to Delta VA CCN for payment with previous original claim from Montana VA as proof of TFL. As Delta of CA was still credentialing providers claims were routed to Montana VA but denied as needing to go to Delta VA.
Thank you for your time with this,
