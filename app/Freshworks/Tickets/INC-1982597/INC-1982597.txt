## Description

Attached pre auth 
Received auth from ins and exp accordingly then rec denials and pt is in adj WQ for $1782.40 from 7/11/2025. Pt is scheduled on 8/15/2025 for other side of osseous and we are expecting from ins based off pre auth response attached. With this pending adjustment and note from ROC we do not want to exp on ins again and rec denial. Is there anything you guys can do on your end and attach the pre tx estimate the ins provided for them to reconsider? We want to get ahead of this to ensure we are collecting correctly on 8/15/2025.
