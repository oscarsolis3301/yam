Hi Vivek,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1984766.



On review found fees populating correctly for code D1110 in FA#863388456. Patient has primary coverage Unitedhealth Group PPO - Dental / Diversified PPO same fees link attached. Verified dental eligibility found UNITED HEALTHCARE PPO [872], DIVERSIFIED PPO with status Verified by Front Office. As per credentialing grid billing provider status is active for DOS. When we review the Epic EOB claim processed based on the GEHA Connection 7I 2024 fees. Hence routed to eligibility to re-verify the eligibility and attach the correct plan to patient coverage &amp; FA. Please let me know for any additional questions. Thank You
