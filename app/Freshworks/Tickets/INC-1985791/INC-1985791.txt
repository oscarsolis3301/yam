## Description

op 8 computer monitor has its brightness on the highest level and its still very dim. Rad board is saying device attempted to access memory that it was not allowed to access, screen looks warped and not bright and seems like the touchscreen function is not really working? The backlight Â on the LED is out or dead since the lighting looks weird. The brightness is on its highest level. Ever since we had the new windows 11 update, the rad board was not working. attached an image of the error message for rad board
