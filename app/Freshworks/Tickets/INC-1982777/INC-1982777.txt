## Description

Good morning,Â 
mom called in to state that she still has this balance and that the check should be on its way to pay off the balance. she is wanting for calls to stop since the check is being issued to pay the amount due to insurance stating that Dr. Latoya Rolle is not in network. Dr. Latoya Rolle is in network. I have submitted a ticket to have that corrected. Her previous name was Dr.Latoya Legrand but that has since been updated for the past few years. I advised mom that the balance remains due to the check not being received yet. She is still asking for me to submit for the balance to be updated since the check has been sent out (per mom)
