I tried rebooted the device from the Wellfit portal.It still shows Tri-POS error.I had customer hold the pound and the yellow to do the soft reset.It still shows Tri-POS error.I had customer pull the battery and reconnect it.Customer said the card reader shows ready now and device 1 is working again.She said device 2 is not working. It still shows Tri-POS on the device display screen even after doing the soft reset and the hard reset.&nbsp;She said that she has to do the hard reset and pull the battery on both card readers every morning and when she gets one of them working the other one stops working
