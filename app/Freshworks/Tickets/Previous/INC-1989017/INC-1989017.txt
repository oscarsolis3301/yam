Hello, 
There is an undistributed insurance payment of $700.88 that is not allocated to the DOS it should be to. It's for DOS 04//05/2024 Heather Kelly with OS, Dr Calder. When I clicked on the "view image" button on the insurance check posting, I was able to locate what it was for. Can you please get this distributed and posted, especially due to end of the month. This is urgent, as our collections need the help. Thanks!
