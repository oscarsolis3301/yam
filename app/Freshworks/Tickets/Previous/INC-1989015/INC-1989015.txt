Hi Mohammed,


Thank you for your ticket submission, The provider or the OD will need
to complete the encounter. They can use the Closing
Erroneous Encounters SRG. They will need to follow the steps in the SRG to close the
encounter. They would open the encounter add a diagnosis of erroneous in the
Add Dx section, then select the erroneous encounter disregard option, after,
they will need to place a note in the note section, sign the note and sign the
encounter. The ticket is being closed at this time to allow the provider time
to review the SRG and complete the steps and if needed reach out to your
regional training team. If further assistance should be needed please re-open
the ticket within 72 hours. Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1989015.
