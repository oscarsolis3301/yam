--- Description ---
Her headsets are too sensative to all noices around her. More than the normal level. We tested with a call to my phone, and i could hear everything in her surrounding in the same volume as I would hear her talking. 
Could we find a way to adjust this or provide her a new headset? 
The pts are constantly complaining they cant hear me but can only hear her neighbors.
