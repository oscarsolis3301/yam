Hi Mirranda,





I wanted to let you know that we’ve received a few TDA claims# 225-949340, 225-949341, 225-949342 under
Dr. Hope Burgess for the DOS 7/22, at the 331 W Parrish Ln, Centerville, 84014 location. However, this provider is not currently credentialed under your TIN 800840767.

 


Would you like to add her to your TIN so this can be processed as in-network?  If you would like us to backdate
 this claim as in-network, please return the attached paperwork at your earliest convenience to: tdacredentialing@emihealth.com





Also, if you would like to get her credentialed with EMI, I have also attached the packet for you to complete and return as well.  This paperwork should be returned to:
provider-relations@emihealth.com







Thank you,






Heidi Turner
