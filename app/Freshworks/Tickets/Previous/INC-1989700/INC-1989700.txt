--- Description ---
 As per review found Principal Financial Group PPO Ins was active from Banding and paid $1000.00 from Banding till 12/24. Then UNITED HEALTHCARE PPO became active from 1/1/25 and paid $525.00 from DOS 1/25-7/25. Total Ins paid $1,525.00. Total Ins Overpaid $525.00.  Per review, we received payment of $125.00 for DOS 1/25 under check #1171204896, where payment received and got refunded. Already previous user moved to ICS to know why the payment got refunded as there is no proper reason for the refund. But got  received the response he patient policy was terminated on 12/31/2024 which was effective from 01/01/2023. Rep said they issued the last payment for Jan 2025, paid amt $125.00, issued on 01/10/2025 under the eft# 1171204896. Since it was paid after the termination date, the payment was refunded back for the amt $125.00. Rep also confirmed that they received the refund amt of $125.00." in this response we got the information for refund amt , now we have a overpayment for 525.00 so need to work for credit, while checking previous notes find previously user raised the trace ticket for "there is no banding ortho codes are available" and we got the response as "rep stated SMINE that the allowed amount for banding claim for D8020 is $1000.00 and there is no patient responsibility. The allowed amount for D8670 $250.00 and there is no patient responsibility. The allowed amount for 8/10/24 for records for pending for D0330, D0340, D0350, D9450 the claim is pending for additional information
that includes need to know patient whether patient had ortho coverage in last 24 months, if so need prior carrier information so the claim was pending for additional information there is no allowed amount" in this response we have a banding D8020 and D8670 allowed amt but there is no amt for records , need to know whether we do have a records payments or not and also check with the patient whether patient had ortho coverage in last 24 months. If we have records payments then want proper fee schedule document with banding ortho codes. So again creating trace ticket
