Hi Rajan,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1989882.

On review FA#869547565 Found plan Delta Dental of AZ PPO - Dental / Delta Premier attached as primary coverage, Verified DE form found same plan is attached. Verified EOB found allowed amount is matching with plan Delta Preferred for code D4341, D4341 UL with deductible in FA and in EOB. Hence routing to eligibility for plan verification. Once verification is completed please route back to ROC FEES to further Review. thank you
