Please review the fees for D7210 As per FA correct fee schedule attached but incorrect fees populating in Epic as insurance expect

Hi Anusuya,

Upon further review i verified provider is INN and FA showing fees have populated as intended per benefits attached.

Checked the web and was unable to download a copy oft the FS but showing First Dental Health EPO. EOB is showing a larger allowable for all codes than the currant f/s available. Will be requesting an updated FS to review and update as necessary.


In the interim, kindly manually align the FA with EOB payments.

Thank You.
Josie Scott

Hi Anusuya,


On review FA#868348323  the plan Principal Financial Group PPO - Dental / First Dental Health EPO as primary coverage for DOS 07/23/2025 code D7210 was populating correctly as per the fees entered in the fees system. Checked in EOB the code D7210 was allowed more than the expected amount without any specific reason and Class of Contract: First Dental Health EPO. Verified in Cyberark and found the same attached in DE form and in fee system. Verified DE form benefits are matched with the EOB. Hence routing to Jocelyn Scott for further review.
