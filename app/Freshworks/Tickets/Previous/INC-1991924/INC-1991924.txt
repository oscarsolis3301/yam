## Description

Hello - this patient is the owner doctors brother and last year we wrote off $1533.38 from what insurance amount was pushed to the patient from his orthodontic account.  For some reason, this charge off was reversed in July and he was sent to collections.  Please remove him from collections and eliminate that balance, we are not charging him for this.  Thank you!
