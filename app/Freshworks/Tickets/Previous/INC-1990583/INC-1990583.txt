--- Description ---
Good morning,Now that the new Okta is up and I'm able to see my tiles I see that Workfront is missing. That seems to be the case for everyone I've checked with. Just to confirm, Workfront is a supported app, not a bookmark.Could you please check that all Workfront users are given their Workfront tile in the new okta screen?Thanks!
