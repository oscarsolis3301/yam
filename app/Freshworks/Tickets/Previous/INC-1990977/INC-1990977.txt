Hello,

Is the malpractice policy triggered automatically for new GP providers or does she need to provide additional information?




Thank you for your help!

Hey Noelle! I hope you are doing well :) I forwarded an email that I received a while ago, but I keep forgetting to ask you about it. Would you please take a look and let me know if I need to take any action on it? Best, Tima Yarmand, DDS ----------
