Per Epic review for DOS- 11/4/2024 CDT: D1206, D2392#15, D1110, D0274, D0230*5, D0220, D0120 has debit balance. Per FA, balance is not PR. Checked with previous call notes states that, claim processed towards capitation. So claim moved to eligibility wq &amp; correct plan type UDC HMO got updated in DE &amp; Epic coverages. Checked in fee finder, no min guarantee sheet found for UDC HMO. Hence raising ticket to update min guarantee Pdf &amp; deferring the claim for 30 days.
