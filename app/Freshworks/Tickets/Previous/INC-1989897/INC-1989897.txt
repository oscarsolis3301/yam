--- Description ---
As per Epic, we received payment from 12/24 to 06/25 and there is no payment for the DOS 10/24 - 11/24 due to waiting period not satisfied. We received two different payment $60.00 and $60.13 for the DOS 12/24 under two different check#618479212, 644405419 and previously sure moved the claim to ICS Inquiry to validate the payment but without proper response moved claim as non workable zero balance
