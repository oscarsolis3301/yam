Hi Aisha,

Theres 2 postings for the same amount. Once was by check, one was by Care Credit.
We received a ticket from accounting requesting the Care Credit to be posted.

It is verified in the Care Credit portal. 

If this was taken in error. Office can submit for a Care Credit refund through EPIC.

Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1989197.
