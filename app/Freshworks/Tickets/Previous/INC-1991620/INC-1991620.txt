Greetings,

Our records show that provider Tony Bassili (NPI 1346467404) is due for recredentialing with Regence
 by 9/1/2025. We recredential every three years.

Please confirm that this provider is still actively practicing under Washington Dental Corporation
 PC. If so, I’ve attached our Recredentialing Verification Form for the provider to complete. Please return the completed form along with copies of their DEA Certificate, Dental License, and Certificate of Professional Liability Insurance by
next Friday 8/8/2025. You can send these directly to DentalProviderRelations@regencedental.com
 (and please CC me). It can take several weeks to process, so it's important we receive the documents early with enough time to process.

If the provider has left the practice, please respond to this email so I can update our records. Should
 you have any questions or concerns, please don’t hesitate to contact me.
 
Thank you,
Gigi Gilboy
