--- Description ---


Since Luke is out of office, we need some other Agent to address this issue as soon as possible.
Hey Luke, for the email forwards that you set up for us, our ServiceNow testers are reporting that they're not receiving emails for:1) compensation@pdshealth.com2) lockboxcredentialing@pdshealth.com  &lt;&lt; this one specifically

 
Could you check these two, and let me know if we have anything out of order?  I checked the spelling, and all looks good.

Also, badinsuranceid@pdshealth.com as a forward will not be used in ServiceNow.  Do I need to create a separate ticket to have that forward removed from the list?
One more question: do you know if pacden.com is still forwarding to pdshealth.com?
