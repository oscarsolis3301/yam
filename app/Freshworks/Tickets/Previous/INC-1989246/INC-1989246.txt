--- Description ---
Having issues with the CBCT/pano machine again. had maintenance come in to try and fix it but it didn't do anything. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. Right now it is not working and we need it back asap. I think IT needs to access it through the computer instead of having someone come in. It just says error 228.Â
