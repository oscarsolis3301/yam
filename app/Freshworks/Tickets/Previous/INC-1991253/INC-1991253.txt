Hi Team, 

Maynor Vargas needs the ServiceNow Test Icon in Okta Apps, it isn't available. 

David Baroi has the ServiceNow Test icon but does not have the agent view, all he has is the service portal (PDSConnect 3.0) the view the offices see.

I am also seeing a 404 page not found when I click on the ServiceNow test icon. It was working fine for me this morning and as of this afternoon it's not. 

Are you able to help with this?
