Hi Elena,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1989821.




A PDS network account has been created and activated your new hire. Please see below their credentials:


Username:     lesley.alfaro
E-mail:       lesley.alfaro@pdshealth.com


Since a new account has been created for them, they will need to create their own individual password, via OKTA. Please note that the new password will be their ONLY passsword, will be valid for the Windows login, OKTA login and their email, and will expire every 90 calendar day, as per the PDS Security Policy. 

To set a new password, please have them go to https://pacificdental.okta.com and log in with the following credentials:

Username:    lesley.alfaro
Password:    S28U&amp;Gs?v!f7

They will be prompted to create a new password that must be at least 12 characters long, have at least one capital letter, at least one number, and at least one special character (!@#$% etc), and enroll into Multi-factor Authentication.
You will no longer be able to use any of your last 12 passwords.

SELF-SERVICE! Please note that once they have access to OKTA, they will be able to reset their own password/unlock his account in real time, as long as they provide a secondary (personal) e-mail address and/or a phone number during the registration process.

If by any chance they missed that step during their initial enrollment, they can always add a phone number or a secondary e-mail address by going to their Name - Settings - Edit profile in their OKTA dashboard. 

If the team member is a brand new hire and they will require Epic access, please make sure they pass their assigned Epic modules and assessments in PDSU, as their Epic access is dependent upon that.  If they are a rehire, and they have completed the Epic modules and assessments in PDSU during their previous employment with PDS, there are no prerequisites to login to Epic other than the setup of their PDS password.


Best regards,
