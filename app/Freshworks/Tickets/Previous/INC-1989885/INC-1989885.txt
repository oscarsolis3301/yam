--- Description ---
As per review, for DOS 01/09/2025 CDT D6010(th#3), D7210(th#30) having debit balance. No claim on file. Per MSI notes denied as PROVIDER IS NOT REGISTERED IN THIS TAX ID SD NEEDS TO UPDATE THE CREDENIGIAL IN REGENCE.COM, So checked in credentialing grid found provider BLAKE C PORTER, LICENSE#1417457524, LICENSE# 7821520, TIN# 80-0870765 and status is IN-PROCESS "NR: Application not on file. Need to resubmit the application". Per DE patient doesn't have OON benefits. Hence raised credentialing ticket to verify and update status of provider with insurance. So defer claim for 14 days.Â
