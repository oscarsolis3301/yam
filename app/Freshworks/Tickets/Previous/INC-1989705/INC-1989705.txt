--- Description ---
Per review, Ins Overpaid $1100.00. As Ins paid more than the Expect amount, need to work for credits, But upon checking no Fee Schedule Document, so already created trace ticket and received responsewhere they have mention allowed amount and copay amount only for Banding, monthly. For 8680 they have mentioned Â D8680 not billed in claim. Since D8680 code will be charged only during Deband, it will be paid in future. We have the allowed amount for D8680 in Minimum Guaranty file. So we need copay amount for D8680. So again created Trace ticket to call ICS to provide us with the copay amount for D8680 from Fee schedule sheet.
