--- Description ---
the Prime scan milling unit needs to connect to DS Core but we have to have a phone connected to the same network as the milling unit and the Prime Scan. But we cannot connect a phone to the same network as the Prime Mill or Prime Scan to be able to use the milling unit. Until we get this addressed we cannot use our prime mill unit.
