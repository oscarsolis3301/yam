--- Description ---
Hello, 
I have spoken to Guardian, the secondary insurance and they stated they did not issue payment due to the primary paying in full. They provided the payment amount of $440.80 NEA #107727700. I then spoke to the primary Blue Cross of ID and they stated they have never issued payment, denied the claim, as well as provided an EOB which I have attached. Can we please resubmit to Guardian for reconsideration as it is my belief they should pay, perhaps they just need the primary EOB.

Thanks,

Shawna
