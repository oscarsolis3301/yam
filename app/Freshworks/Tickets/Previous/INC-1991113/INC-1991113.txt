Hi jessica.logsdon,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1991113.




After reviewing the account, I have verified that Delta Health Systems is showing in coverages as active as of 5/1/25 and so it has already been added to visit for DOS 7/1/25 and billed out as primary on 7/4/25 with invoice # A10110567170. Please review account and verify what else is needed. Thank you.
