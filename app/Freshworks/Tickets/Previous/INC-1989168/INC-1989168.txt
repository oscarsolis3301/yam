--- Description ---
Hello- I am unable to add this provider to my snapboard- the office is not showing up as an option. I was told that it will not show up until his credentialling is complete but it was told to me that it was completed on 7/29 and we are still having trouble. Can you let me know the status of his credentialling for office 347?Â
