--- Description ---
Ins exp is $0.00 and found Ins DBP was revised as $0.01 for banding 02/14/2025 with the description of """"unbilled"""". As per review found that the insurance paid $ 1440.00 from banding till 3/25 including records and received PR 119 ortho max met so there wont be any more payment from the insurance and no need to check the reimbursement. The total insurance payment $ 1440.00 and excess paid $ 1440.00 and outstanding credit is $ 1439.99 as the insurance overpaid need to check the HMO credit calculator but as there is no fee schedule for the plan 2 . Hence previously created trace ticket # 1936445 and received response as rep verified and stated as the patient has only PPO for code D8070-$5319.00 , D9450$ 58.00, D0330-$73.00, D0340-$80.00, D0350-$ 42.00, D0470-$ 74.00, D9310-$ 91.00, D8670$ 317.00, D8680-$ 520.00and no copay in PPO plan and rep stated the patient has only PPO not HMO. As the received response is not correct and as the patient has only PPO plan but as per checking found that patient has HMO plan initially hence again raised an fee schedule ticketÂ
