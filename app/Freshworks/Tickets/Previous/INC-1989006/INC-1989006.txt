--- Description ---
I'm reaching out for assistance regarding a denied claim for one of our patients. I contacted Delta Dental of MI and confirmed that the patient does have active dental insurance. I also provided the claim number to the representative, who informed me that the claim had been incorrectly billed to Delta Dental of New Mexico.
