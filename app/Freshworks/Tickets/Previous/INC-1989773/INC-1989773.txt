--- Description ---
Per review, Ins Overpaid $300.00. As Ins paid more than the Expect amount, need to work for Credits. But upon checking in Fee Finder, we can't able to find the Fee schedule with Ortho code copay amount for our plan and Banding year. Without Fee Schedule Copay amount, we can't work for credits. Hence created Trace ticket to call ICS to get the copay amount for our plan and banding year for all ortho codes (8080,8670,8680,9310,9450,0330,0340,0350,0470).
