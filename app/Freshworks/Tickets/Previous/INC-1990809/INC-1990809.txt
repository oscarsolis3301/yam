Hi Kettya,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1990809.



To get access to Outlook on your mobile phone, you'll have to first submit a Workday request for MDM access. You can do this by doing the following:

Go to Workday
Click on the menu icon at the top left
Click on Requests

Click Create Request

In the search bar, type MDM and hit the enter key (What should fill in is Request - MDM Program Enrollment)
Click on OK



Once you do that, a request will be sent to management to be approved. Once approved, you'll receive an email to accept the terms and conditions of the request. After doing that, please follow the attached documentation on how to set up the Company Portal application on your mobile phone. As you'll note, there's one for iOS and Android, so follow the one for the kind of phone you have.

If you have any issues submitting the Workday request or following the documentation I attached, please give us a call at 714-845-8895.


Thanks,
