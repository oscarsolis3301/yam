--- Description ---
When milling a crown it's giving an error saying "Positioning Failed" (401016) there was an error message prior and i was not able to write down the number it gave. we currently have a patient in the chair and we have no other way to cement a temporary crown. This is an EMERGENCY as the patient will have nothing covering the tooth while we wait.
