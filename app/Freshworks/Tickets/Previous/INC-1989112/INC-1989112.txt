--- Description ---
I have added the screenshot for your reference -
the guarantor account only shows one payment posted of $90 however the patient has two transactions of $90 on his statement. I have attached the wellfit payments screen showing he was in fact charged twice for $90 - this is an error - are  you able to refund the patient one of the $90 charges
