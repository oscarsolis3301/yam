Multi-Factor Authentication for Care Coordination Portal Access    
To increase protection for the Managed Care Organization Care Coordination Portal’s  and member information data, signing in will soon require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). MFA is a two-factor authentication process that takes user verification a step beyond the State of Ohio (OHID) and password. This is done by using a second source of validation (i.e. text message, email, passkey, phone call) to verify user identify before granting access.
