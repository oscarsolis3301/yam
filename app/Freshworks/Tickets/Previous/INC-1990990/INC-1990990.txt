--- Description ---
DTX is not opening.


--- Conversation ---

I checked customers DTX settings and the password information was not saved. 
I entered the password for the office and saved it. 
I had customer try to open DTX from Epic and it opened this time.
user: xxx-office name
password: PD$Officexxx

I checked customers DTX settings and core was not connected. The url was wrong.
I corrected the url using the correct format https://xxx-1VU1.pdsi.corp.33000 and added the core user name xxx-(officename) and core password 1K@voC0re! information and saved the information. I had customer try to open DTX from Epic and it opened this time.

DTX integration fix:
I went DTX settings and checked if the PMS integration was enabled.
I into Programs\PDS Integration\Epic Integration\
and restarted the DTX integration. 
I had customer test it she confirmed that it's working again.

DTX Folder sync fix:
I deleted the patient, transfer and sync folder and relaunched DTX with my admin.
I had user test it she confirmed that it's working again.
I checked her DTX folder on the C: and it was not shared so I logged in with my admin and shared the folder and added authenticated users.

DTX Core not connected:
I checked the PMS integration in DTX and it was missing.
I added the check and saved it. I tested it in Epic and tried launching DTX on a test account and confirmed that it launches.
I called Jocelyn back and had her test it and confirmed that DTX is launching from Epic again.
