--- Description ---
Please audit these sibling accounts.  Last visit were billed and denied for safeguard Hmo, they haven't had that in a long time.  They have the delta and mom has updated office several times, I am unsure as to why the safeguard was not removed and delta wasn't billed.  Please advise mom does not want to be responsible for $132 for each account she gave us updated insurance for Delta after Safeguard termed. We should not have billed safeguard last visit.
