--- Description ---
As per review found ins paid $1,450.15 from banding till 7/2025 and no denial as of now so left that it is. Upon checking the payments found dos of 7/2024 to 10/2024 payments are posted twice in epic with the check no #100485179 , while verified in EPIC found that provider change claim is billed on 07/24. Provider changed from "STEPANEK, CHRISTINE to HAYKANI, SHADI" . So payments from 07/24 -10/24 is paid again in new provider, need to know what to do with the payments done for old provider. Is it needed to be recouped or not and also checked previous notes found previously user moved the claim to ICS inquiry for same concern , but still there is no response receive , so again routing to ICS inquiry to verify the payments which is made for old provider as well as new provider, found there is no any other Audit WQ hence created trace ticketÂ
