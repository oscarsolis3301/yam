Per review in previous notes, stated that claim was processed and denied as provider last name was incorrect. Per credential grid found provider name EVA BERNACIAK, NPI#1750937991, LIC#D01041 is listed and found the same was updated in claim form and per grid provider status is Inprocess. Previously raised a ticket#1859349 and received response as Upon checking the provider's Credentials, provider's last name is Wszolek. And another ticket#1901894 received response as Upon checking the credentials and NPI Registry, provider's last name is Bernaciak which is also updated in the payers end. Since there was a contradiction between the two tickets and rep suggest to submit the correct claim, hence creating a another ticket#
