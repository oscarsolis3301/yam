--- Description ---
We see patients with the VA through the Community Care Program, claims being issued through Delta VA Community Care.  They use an online portal called HSRM (HealthShare Referral Manager).  This is an online portal that the VA/Tri-West uses for treatment referrals, authorizations, treatment updates, patient/provider messaging, etc.  I have initiated the process to get this portal established for our office.  We have been sending faxes to the VA in the past, but the portal is substantially quicker, easier to use, and has real time transparency on our Veteran's dental care.  These are the steps I've taken so far to setup the portal.  My OM suggested I submit this ticket to keep the process documented, and to provide us any assistance at the office level we might need.  I started this process at the office level due to the nature of all people needing access to the portal to have a personal ID.me account setup through the federal government.

1) I established my own ID.me account
2) I have submitted the requisite End Use Tracker form with my information to the VA HRSM email address to give us access to the HSRM portal. 

I've attached a copy of the HSRM Account Setup Guide as a reference.
