Hi Marcie, 

I was hoping you can help me out with.

I need to maximize my HSA withdrawal at my next paycheck for Aug 7. I believe it would be for the amount of $2058.37. This would max me out for HSA paycheck withdrawal. Thus going forward HSA withdrawal would be zero. 




Please let me know 

Thank you, 

Dr. Ghaffar

Hi Marcie,



Thank you for opening this request with us. I would be happy to assist. I took a look at Dr. Ghaffar's record and noticed that there were two sick days taken for the second pay period
 of June but her sick time off balance renewed on 07/01/2024. 



Effective 7/1/2024, her sick time off balance is 40 hours (5 full days).



Let me know if you have any questions and I hope you have a great rest of your day.



Happy fourth of July!



Best,

Hello @*Payroll - Provider Pay,



 

Dr. Ghaffar is going on a leave in August and wants to know how much sick pay she currently has. My records indicate that she has 40 hours remaining. However, she mentioned she did take some.
