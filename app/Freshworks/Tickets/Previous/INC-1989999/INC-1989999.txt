--- Description ---
Good morning, for this patient it says there are no fees attached to this plan, but it seems like they might have manually put in. Please advise.

Hi ariana.cruz,

Thank you
for reaching out to Patient Benefits!
 
Unfortunately,
we are unable to proceed with this request.
 
• Per Cred Grid, office is OON with Delta Legion.
 
• For this
reason, the plan is not available / Fees will not populate in EPIC.

 
The office
may choose to honor the fees associated at the office’s discretion.
 
• If so,
the office will need to attach the patient to self-pay coverage and manually
coordinate fees.

 
Thank You.
Josie Scott
