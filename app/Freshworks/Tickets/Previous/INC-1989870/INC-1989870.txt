--- Description ---
Claim billed to Pri Â DELTA DENTAL OF CA PPO . Ins Paid $231.00 only for records, found banding claim has been denied as 251-missing attachment. Upon checking in website for DDCA PPO found that the banding claim was received on 3/6/25 processed and denied on 3/11/25 as Benefits could not be determined because of insufficient, illegible, or missing primary coverage information. Please submit a new request with an itemized copy of the denial and/or payment notification from the primary plan. Verified in Clinical docs, found COB in which it is mentioned as DD OF CA PPO as primary &amp; ANTHEM BC OF CA PPO as a secondary. Therefore need to call &amp; reprocess the claim stating DD OF CA PPO is the primary then how come the claim has been denied stating of primary EOB. As no other open wq is available, hence raised trace ticket
