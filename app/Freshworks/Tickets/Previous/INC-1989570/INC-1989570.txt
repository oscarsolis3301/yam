As per review found that ins paid for banding till 06/2025 , and insurance is paying Monthly as per previous payments, but for the DOS 09/2024 there is a two payments under the same chq # 100023473, So checked in OnBase there is no information found, also checked in Web no EOB found for the DOS 09/2024 under the provider Jeffrey Lenius, there is no WQ to route.
