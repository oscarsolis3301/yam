Hi Gerardo,

I have voided the refund to Jacob, please confirm whether we were needing to reprocess refund under Marlina or if you just wanted credit to be reapplied to the account. Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1989392.

Robert,
   sorry I know this is not your office. Donna did not say who to send Esmeraldas offices to.
can you please void this refund. Not sure if they need a new refund or just reapply the credit.
