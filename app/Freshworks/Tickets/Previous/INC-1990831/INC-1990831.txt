--- Description ---
This patient had oral surgery to have wisdom teeth removed on 7/22/25 and it appears that the dental insurance was in fact billed and processed, however I do not see where the Medical plan was billed. I do see some notes about this medical plan "not medically billable", but the parent has called and asked that we Do submit a claim to the medical plan because her deductible has already been met and she knows they will cover 70% of extractions.
Will you please submit initial claim to medical insurance which is also United Healthcare. The card is scanned into registration.
