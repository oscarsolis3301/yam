Hi, this pt came in on 7/24/25 for a crown and she wanted to pay in cash and on her card. She gave me $500 in cash and wanted to do the rest on her card. When i posted the cash I forgot to change the amount from the full $989.50 to $500. Our AM tried fixing it for me but now we're worried she is going to get a check of the full amount. Anna Sohaei is working on stopping the check but she asked me to send a ticket in the meantime to get it fixed. Thank you for all of your help!Â
