--- Description ---
Guar ID#: 800987322. It is an unbilled claim billed of $0.01 to roll for banding DOS and in FA no ins expect found. We received payment for banding dos 07/24. Insurance is an quarterly payor as per all payer records and still there is tmt length. Need to check HMO Credit and Reimbursement Calc in order to take action. There is fee schedule for  AETNA HMO  but there is no allowed amount for D8090, D8670, D8680, D9310, D9450, D0330, D0340, D0350, D0470 codes. So can't able to do calculations. Previously created a fee schedule help ticket #1809933 and got response as "Here is the co-pay file for Aetna HMO. Please contact insurance if code is still not on there.". Checked the attached file still the codes are not there and the attached file is already we have in CG. Due to no proper response on the previous ticket, creating another Trace HT to follow up on the ins regarding allowed amount of banding code D8090 and records codes
