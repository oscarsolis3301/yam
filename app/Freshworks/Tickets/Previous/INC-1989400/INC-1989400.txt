The webcam to take patient photos is not working. It keeps connecting to the intraoral camera or not connecting at all. We have been using arrow button instead of pressing "new photo" just as Stacy V. informed us to use. Please log in and see if there is anything you can do to help. Thank you.D0394-XR3D1A

I connected to the users pc. I checked Device Manager and it shows the device is detected:

I disabled the Webcam in DTX 
I had customer test the device and they confirmed the webcam is working.
