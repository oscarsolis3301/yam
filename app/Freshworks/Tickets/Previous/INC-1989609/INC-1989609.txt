Hi Sachin,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1989609.



On review FA#734962045 found plan Nevada Dental Benefits PPO - Dental / UCR attached as Primary coverage. In fees system Nevada Dental Benefits PPO - Dental / UCR plan not found but it's comes under Miscellaneous  UCR plan. Verified DE form found same plan is attached. Verified EOB insurance allowed and paid less amount than the FA without any specific reason for code D1110. Payer has different UCR than PDS &amp; office needs to manually coordinate with carrier to sort carrier payment, Hence resolving this ticket, Please let me know for any additional questions, Thank you.
