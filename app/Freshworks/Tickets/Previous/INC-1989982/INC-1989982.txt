--- Description ---
However found that pri ins got termed on 8/31/2024 but we have received payment till dos 9/24. Â Already raised ticket and rep stated that an overpayment letter will be issued and no further payments will be made, checked in guar docs the overpayment letter is not posted yet. Later in call notes dated 5/16/2025 " Per rep the last action that taken for this patient is on 02/18/2025. As of now the processor not issued the letter to us. So, the rep made a follow up on this and will request for the overpayment letter since the patient policy termed on 08/31/2024. The rep took the claim back for reprocess. TAT is 10 - 15 business days". The TAT is satisfied but the overpayment letter is not issued yet. As there is no active wq creating trace ticket.
