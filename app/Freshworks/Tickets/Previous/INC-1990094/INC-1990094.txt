Hi Dajah,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1990094.



Thank you for your request. 

Please ensure that you are trying to access your Outlook via the NEW Okta tenant - https://pdshealth.okta.com/. 

If this is your first time using the new site, you’ll be asked to set up multi-factor authentication (MFA) — a quick extra security step to help protect your account. For help, check out the attached Quick Reference Guide (QRG) with step-by-step instructions.

As per the previous communications, PDS Health is transitioning to a new Okta tenant starting 8/1/2025.

Here are a few helpful reminders:

Your credentials (username and password) haven’t changed.
Be sure you've completed registration and MFA setup in the new tenant.
Personal bookmarks from your old dashboard won't transfer automatically. You’ll need to recreate them—see the attached guide for help.
