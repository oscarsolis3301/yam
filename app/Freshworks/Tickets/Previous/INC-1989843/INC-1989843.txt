--- Description ---
As per review, we received payment for banding and records only. Outstanding credit is $1928.00. Need to perform HMO credit calc but upon checking in fee finder and document finder no fee schedule that contains ortho codes in it. So need allowed amount fee schedule. There's no WQ to route
