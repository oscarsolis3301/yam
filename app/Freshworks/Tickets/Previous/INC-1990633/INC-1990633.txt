--- Description ---
Some of the apps I had access to in pacificdental Okta are missing from my pdshealth Okta. 
I need the following applications for my daily work: Lucidchart, BlueDolphin - PROD, and PDS Health GPT. 
I would also like to have We Serve Center and Smile Generation Merch Store. Thank you!
I also appear to have both a MOD and MOD (Dual IDP) tiles. Do I need both?
