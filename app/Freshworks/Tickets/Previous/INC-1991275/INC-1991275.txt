Hello, reaching out because patient called us today and asked about status on the refund check that was processed on 6/20/2025. She still hasn't received it, I did verify the address we have on file is correct for her. Can someone please look into this for me and why it is taking so long for her to receive it? Thank you in advance for your help. Ashlyn

Hi wiederholta,

Refund was processed back to CC on file not via check. Patient will need to reach out to the bank and reference the transaction ID on the refund receipt.
