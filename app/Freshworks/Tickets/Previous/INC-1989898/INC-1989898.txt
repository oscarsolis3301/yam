Hi Shamsundhar,


On review FA#865120807 found plan Liberty Dental Plan PPO / Dentalguard Preferred attached as primary coverage for the DOS 07/18/2025 code D2330 was populating correctly. Verified EOB found the code D2330 was allowed less than the expected amount without any specific reason. Upon reviewing the allowed amount matching with Liberty EPO for the code D2330. Checked in CG liberty dental is not available for the billing provider. Hence routing this ticket to eligibility team for plan verification.
