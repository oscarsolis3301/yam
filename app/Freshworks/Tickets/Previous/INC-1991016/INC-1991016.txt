Good afternoon,
Patient says her MasterCard x5927 is no longer active, but was pushed through for a refund yesterday. Can we please cancel the refund and send a check?

Hi Jennifer,

Unfortunately, we cannot reverse a CC refund once it has been processed. If CC was inactive at time of refund we would've received an error message and been forced to refund via check. Patient will need to reach out to their bank and reference the transaction ID on the refund receipt.
