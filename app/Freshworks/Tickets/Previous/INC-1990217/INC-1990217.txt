Hi Angela,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1990217.

I greatly apologize for the delay but that's great news!!! There likely were some configurations that simply needed time to set in after our team members worked on your office, so hearing you're rocking and rolling once again is welcome news.Â 

For now, we'll close this out but let us know if you run into any other issues. Have a great weekend ahead!Â 

Kind regards,Â

I tried to remap it and it shows the printer is mapped but I can't get a test page to print.
