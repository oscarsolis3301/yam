--- Description ---
As per review found ins paid $365.50 for banding and found Ins has Zero expect, but we have paid amt for $365.50. As ins is a overpaid need to check HMO credit calc using fee schedule, while checking fee schedule found there is no banding ortho codes are available for the plan and the plan name is "Aetna HMO - Dental / Plan 2ba", and also checked previously user raised trace ticket for same concern and we got the response as  "Rep stated that Copay doesn't apply for Ortho and it is based on a coinsurance plan" in this response we don't have copay amt for the plan and also they suggest for coinsurance plan, but in fee schedule there is no coinsurance plan are available ,  need to know proper fee schedule documents for the plan , so again creating trace ticket
