--- Description ---
previous user created trace ticket under INC#1861703 to check why payments not received as pat has visit 1/25,2/25,3/25,5/25 received response as "rep stated that they can't assist and give the claim status over call to the third party since the call from our office is considered as third party, Rep suggested to use DNOA Web for further assistance. As we didn't receive proper response as third party concern again created Trace ticket for Onshore review. Ticket# 1917781 as response upon checking in DE found that the mode of payment is mentioned as auto-quarterly payor but due to tpc unable to get claim status and payment information via call. hence again created ICS Trace ticket Â to assign this ticket to Onshore team
