 As per review, found payments received for banding and monthlies till 07/25. Took roc reversal adjustment for provider change. Plb Payment Of $1419.5 Posted, I Could Find Positive Payment In Clearing Account #900002085, So Transferred It Our Guarantor. Upon checking, the total production is $1419.5 and the remaining production is $905.5. upon checking found that the ins payment will exceed the treatment length. Hence checked the ppo reimbursement calc using the values from MetLife 09967 CO Zip 801 2023 from fee finder.as per the calc found the reimbursement amount to be $ 3052 which is greater than the ins expect. Hence created trace ticket# to get the total amount ins will pay. Need to verify the correct reimbursement amount.
