Hi Karla,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1989368.

MRN#24969114 INV B10910065760 DOS 07/10/25 INS  DELTA DENTAL OF CA PPO Per EOB Insurance paid a total of $92.80 to the subscriber. The office did not collect payment. Please reach out to the subscriber to collect the remaining $92.80. Not collecting the total OON insurance payment can cause. (1) An inability to give unexpected production to the providers. (2) Allows the patient to keep overpayment that is due to the insurance. (3) Can cause future invoices to be left underpaid when plan max is met because we do not have the valid OON overpayment to consolidate. (4) May leave a balance on the invoice due to full payment not being collected which will need to be written off the provider since office didn't collect the full OON insurance payment
