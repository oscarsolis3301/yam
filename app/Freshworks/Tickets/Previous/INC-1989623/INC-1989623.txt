As per review for DOS 07/23/2025, CDT D2330(TH#27,#24,#23,#22,#9) has debit balance. As per ERA claim Charges are covered under a capitation agreement/managed care plan. Minimum guarantee is $0 and copay is $70 . Insurance reimbursement = min guarantee - copay = $0 - $70 = $-70. So there is no insurance reimbursement available. Per FA, FA contains dashes. As per latest SOP update, need to create ticket and defer. So creating eligibility ticket# to verify and attach correct fee schedule.
