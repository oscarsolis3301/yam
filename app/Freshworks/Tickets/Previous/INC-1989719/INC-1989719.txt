Per review, Ins Overpaid $1470.05. As Ins paid more than the Expect amount, need to work for credits, But upon checking no Fee Schedule Document, so already created trace ticket. and received response as "found that the allowed amount for banding claim for D8090 is $800.00 and copay for D8080 is $400.00, allowed amount for D8670 is $133.34 and copay for D8670 is $66.67 for each month. There is no allowed and copay for records D0330, D0340, D0350, D0470 as the records claim was denied and For proc code D8680 the there is no allowed amount and copay as deband was not yet charged". we didn't received any copay amount for D8680. Since D8680 code will be charged only during Deband, it will be paid in future. So we need copay amount for D8680 to perform calc. So again created Trace ticket to call ICS to provide us with the allowed amount and copay amount for D8680 from Fee schedule sheet.
