Hi Team,

Thank you for reaching out to Patient Benefits. Unfortunately, we are unable to verify benefits.
Please see below for resolution details:
• We have reached out to the carrier; however, the patient was unable to be found with the information provided on the dental eligibility form.

Next Steps:
• Please review both the subscriber and patient information to ensure it is accurate.
• If there is an update to the coverage you may reopen or submit a new ticket to have it
reverified.
We do apologize for the inconvenience.

Kindly,
