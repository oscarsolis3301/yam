Good Morning Alex,
 
I left a couple of messages in your office. I am reaching out on behalf of Delta Dental. I am following up on the application
 and fee schedule sent for the Delta Dental Legion Network. Is the practice interested in moving forward with participation? If so, I have attached a guideline to assist in completing the application. Please feel free to reach out with any questions. 
 
Thank you

Good Afternoon Alex,
 
I spoke with Gabriel at your office earlier today.  I was informed that Fernando Saavedra is no longer at the practice.  Yulissa Alvarez Sanchez is the
 current provider there. I am reaching out on behalf of Delta Dental. We are building a TRICARE network, known as "Delta Dental Legion".  The Legion Network is accessible to Delta Dental's Government clients. We'd very much like to have your practice join this
 network to provide dental services for active-duty service members and their family members.
 
Please find the following attachments:
Legion Network fee schedule
ZIP file containing Agreement and required documentation to be returned with executed agreement
Credentialing Application
Tip sheet outlining all required documentation
 
The credentialing documents only need to be completed if she is not enrolled in CAQH.  She can join CAQH by visiting

www.CAQH.org. The credentialing application would need to be returned alongside the contract packet.
 
Note that all documentation is to be returned to my email address so that I may expedite the process. I'll be in touch with you sometime next week to ascertain
 interest and/or address any questions you may have.
 
 
Thank you in advance for your attention; we look forward to your participation!
