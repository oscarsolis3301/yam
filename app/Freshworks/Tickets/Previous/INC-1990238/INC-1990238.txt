--- Description ---
Hi ROC Team,

I’m reaching out for assistance in locating insurance coverage for one of our patients. I attempted to find the plan myself but was unable to locate any information, and I’ve also been unsuccessful in reaching a representative.

Could you please look into this for me when you get a chance? Let me know if you need any additional details to proceed.

Thanks so much for your help!

Thank you for reaching out to Patient Benefits! 

After contacting the carrier, we found that the patient does not have dental coverage under this policy. 

Services rendered on this date of service (DOS) will not be paid. 

Please review and update the patient’s dental policy prior to a re-verification request.

Verified this however this policy has only pediatric plan and the member is not elig due to an age limit.

Kindly,
