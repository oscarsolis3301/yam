--- Description ---
Hello, can you assist us with creating a credit on the pt's account for $600? The pt paid $600 with a credit card that was absorbed into a pt initial ortho charge debit. The pt later paid $2700 with care credit (the full case fee) and wanted the $600 refunded as they paid with a different form of payment, but the $600 and $2700 were both absorbed in pt initial ortho charge debits. Can you void the initial pt ortho charge debit so we can refund the $600 paid with a credit card? Thanks!
