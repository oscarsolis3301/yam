Ashley, 

There is not an issue with you doing so - thank you for completing action however patient can be located by name in addition to MRN if either and/or both are provided. At the time you provided correct MRN account had already been notated and ticket resolved with next steps therefore action taken was not necessarily needed. Upon my reiteration of original response my statement to not reopen help ticket was in the case you did so in error because not only when you provide a reply to a help ticket is reopened but also because it was resolved prior to you providing correct MRN. 

Thank you for attempting to alleviate my job duties and task however I was able to locate patient by name provided. 

Help ticket has been resolved with resolution providing next steps for office action:
