Hi Stephanie,

Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1984466.

Thank you for your ticket request. We have reviewed the patient account per your request. Per review patient banded on 11/15/2024 for 24 M. Per FA primary ins expect is $0.00. As per the office request need to submit the additional info of CEPH to the insurance and is stating we can submit the doc from 10/16/2024. But upon checking the clinical docs the attached doc for the date 10/16/2024 is Pano not CEPH. So, need to know whether we can submit the pano instead of CEPH from the date 10/16/2024. Or else can you please attach the correct CEPH to send to the insurance. 

Thank you
