Hi hina.rahim,

Thank you for submitting your ticket. For this issue I see that there are two plans in Epic Registration and only one in Dental Eligibility (see below). When I go into Dental Eligibility, I see the one plan, Aetna, does not have the entire form filled out. For example the patient's treatment plan includes a prophy but the prophy boxes in DE are not completed (see below). In order for the Treatment Plan to pull fees the insurances have to match exactly between DE and Epic and the DE form has to be filled out for all procedures you are treatment planning. If you need help or have any further questions please contact your OM, RM or you Regional Front Office Trainer for additional support as this is not a system issue.
