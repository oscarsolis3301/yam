Hi Team




I am writing to inform you that a member of my team is experiencing login issues with PDS Epic. The user recently changed his  password, and since then, he has been unable to log in. The warning message displayed is: "User authentication is blocked for your
 account. Contact your system administrator to unblock your account." However, he can still access the PDS AD account home page. Could you please unblock this account?
