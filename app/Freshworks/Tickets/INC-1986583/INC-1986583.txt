Hi allison.martinez,

Unfortunately, we are unable to proceed with this request.
 
• Verified Delta Legion is attached to DE benefits. Per Cred Grid, office is OON.

 
• For this reason, the plan is not available / Fees will not populate in EPIC.

 
The office may choose to honor the fees associated at the office’s discretion.
 
• If so, the office will need to attach the patient to self-pay coverage and manually coordinate fees.

 
Thank You.
Josie Scott
