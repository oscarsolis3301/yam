Hi Vanessa,


Per review coverage tab reflects records (1) and (2) are duplicates also, the id# does match the id# in the DE form. Please review and correct to update the visit to bill. please accurately term the incorrect insurances and
ensure that the correct active insurance has a matching DE form completed.
Thank you.
