Per Patterson, you will need to reach out to your PDS Regional Team to start the process of getting an oven on order internally within PDS. Then, PDS Corporate will send the order to Patterson.

However, if you have any further issues, please submit another IT ticket or contact the IT Service Desk at 714-845-8895.


Thank you.
