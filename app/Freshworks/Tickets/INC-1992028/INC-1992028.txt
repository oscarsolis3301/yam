## Description

Guarantor #800882248, As per review in epic, ins paid $175 for records and $2000 for banding. From history, patient has not started the treatment, so already banding payment is refunded. When checking records payment, ins paid $175 for D0470, D0340 &amp; D0330, but also those charges are voided. From chart notes, patient has visited only for consult. So not sure whether we need to refund the record payment or we can consider. Hence raised trace ticket ### to follow up with the ins.
