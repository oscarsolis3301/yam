## Description

Per review, A28310180980 has been voided and A28310192871 has been created for DOS 01/10/2024. Per review CDT D4341(LL,LR,UL,UR) received payment $120.00 under check# 007990009032678 and it was voided and the payment has been undistributed. Per review CDT D4341(LL,LR,UL,UR) has been voided and reposted. Per EPIC coverage DELTACARE HMO is primary and SAFEGUARD HMO is secondary. Initially claim filled to secondary insurance so voided and rebilled to primary insurance. So, requesting to send corrected claim to SAFEGUARD HMO for DOS 01/10/2024 as insurance paid incorrectly as primary.Â

Hi Monika,

Ticket closed due to no active DE or coverage reflecting for SAFEGUARD. If safeguard insurance was valid then an active DE needs to be created. Thank you!Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1984958.
