## Description

As per account review INS expect is $0.00 but DBP was rolling for $0.01 with the description of "unbilled" and INS paid from banding till 05/25 including initial records, Since INS over paid we need to check HMO credit calculator but copay amount was not available in fee schedule document for ortho codes, Previous created Trace ticket under # 1943004 we received response with allowed amount and copay for all ortho code expect D8680, Therefore again creating Trace ticket under # to get the Fee schedule Document for our plan Â 2BA or allowed and copay for D8680. Once we get response from ICS will work accordingly,
