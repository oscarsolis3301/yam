Hi Angappan,

On review FA#861818869 the plan Guardian PPO - Dental / Dentalguard Preferred as primary coverage for DOS 07/15/2025 code D4346 was popualting correctly. Checked in DE form the benefits are matching with EOB for the code D4346. In EOB the code D4346 was allowed less with remark code 45 and the allowed amount is matching with old fee schedule of Dentaguard Preferred. Checked in CG the billing provider is active for the DOS hence resolving this ticket and refile the claim with correct  fee schedule. Thank you
