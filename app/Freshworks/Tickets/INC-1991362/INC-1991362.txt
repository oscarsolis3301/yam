## Description

Hello team,
Can we please submit a corrected claim for PT Jeffrey Neavitt (MRN #10477973) for DOS 05/08/2025. Per the rep at Delta Dental, they requested a corrected claim to include the added note from provider Dr. Pourya Shahnaz stating initial placement of bridge 28-30 was completed. They did request to please not include the core build-ups, as these were already paid and could cause them to deny it again due to being 'duplicated claims'.Â 
Please include addended note in EPIC per provider Dr. Pourya Shahnaz on DOS 05/08/2025. Thank you!
