Hi Cody,

This just be an issue with the curly cord or the handset.  You can test this one of two ways.  You can put a call on speaker phone and set the receiver down, or you can swap the curly cord and handset of a phone that isnt experiencing any static and see if the trouble goes away.  Let me know if it proves to be the curly cord and handset please?Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1991417.
