Hi Trysta,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1981453.

Thank you for reaching out to Patient Benefits.

Upon further review, it appears that the patient’s DeltaCare plan is only available in the state of “TEXAS”.
• The patient’s dental plan does not offer out of state benefits. 
•There would not be any insurance reimbursement.
• Fees will not populate on the plan for this reason.

Next Steps:
• The office must attach self-pay.

Please let us know if anything else is needed.


Kindly,
