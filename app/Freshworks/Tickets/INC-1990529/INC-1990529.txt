Dear Dr. Miko Okayama Crawford,
 
We are writing to confirm that we have received your completed application to join GEHA’s Connection Dental Network as of August 1, 2025. 
 
What to expect next:
 
Your application has started the credentialing process. We will contact you if there are any questions or concerns. The average time to complete the credentialing process is 30 - 45 days. Once the review process is complete, your application will be sent to the Peer Review Committee for a decision.
 
After a committee decision:
 

You will receive a notification of decision within 10 days of the Committee’s review of your application. Upon approval, your welcome letter will be emailed to you, unless your state law requires differently. The letter will include your network effective date, which is different from the Committee Approval date, the date your GEHA claims will be paid with in-network benefits. Please note, your network participation date can average about 30 - 60 days from the completed application date in paragraph one. Lastly, participation effective dates with other Payors may vary. Please contact the Payor directly for participation status within their plans or products.
