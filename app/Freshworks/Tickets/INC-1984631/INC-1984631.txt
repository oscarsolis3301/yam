Hi Gajalakshmi,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1984631.



On review found fees populating correctly for code D4910 in FA#853247096. Benefits updated after record was finalized. Replace to update amounts. Patient has Primary coverage Companion Life PPO / Advantage Plus fees link attached United Concordia - Advantage Plus - Advantage Plus MN Reg 45. Verified dental eligibility found COMPANION LIFE PPO [409], ADVANTAGE PLUS with status N/A. When we review the EOB claim not processed based on the Advantage Plus PPO fees. As per credentialing grid billing provider status is INN for DOS. Hence routed to eligibility to re-verify the eligibility and attach the correct plan to patient coverage &amp; FA. Please let me know for any additional questions. Thank You
