Good Morning,
The account has been recalled from collections and the balance is now back on the account. Please remember to adjust off the balance to avoid the account being resent to collections or appearing on your unsecured report. Should you have any questions please feel free to let me know?

 Yes, we will be.





Warm Regards,
