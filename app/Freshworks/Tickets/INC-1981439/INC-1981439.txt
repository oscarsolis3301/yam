Hi Jenea,

Taking another look at the provider. Looks like the provider is termed in Epic. The provider is not available in Workday or TMP. 

Unfortunately, the
Epic team cannot add any provider to Epic until an Add Provider Request form
has been submitted to Team Member Processing (TMP) for review. Once the
contract is signed by the Provider and Owner Dentist, this triggers an
automated ticket for all teams needing notification: Access, Epic, Workday and
Credentialing.
 
The form is located
here: https://www.pdsconnect2.com/forms/add-new-provider-form/,
and it must be filled out and submitted to Payroll in order for a provider to
be set up in Epic.
 
We will process the
request as quickly as possible after the Add Provider process in TMP is
completed. If you have any questions about the form, please contact Payroll at
AddProviderRequest@pacden.com &lt;AddProviderRequest@pacden.com&gt; for further
assistance.
 
Thank you.

Even when I switch the snap board setting to non-private it won't allow me to add/open her template under "edit tempklate"  - it keeps showing "reno gp"

Hi Jenea,

The department snapboard was updated on 7/8. I took a look in Epic and it looks like you have several private saved versions of the snapboard.

The Epic team only maintains department snapboards and cannot update private saved versions of the snapboards. Please
note that if you are working off of a private/personal snapboard, there is a
lock icon to the left of the snapboard name, these updates will not be
reflected. Thank you.
