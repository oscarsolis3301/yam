## Description


Hello Credentialing Team,
I have an IC (Dr. Hania Alkudmani, Periodontist) who has been with us for several years and works in offices 785, 784, 723, 780,and 774, who will be joining a Perio Group and will become a sub-IC effective 9/1/2025. 

Will this transition have any impact on credentialing and is there anything I need to do as we prepare for this transition?
