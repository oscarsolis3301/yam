Hi Esmeralda,

All of our DeltaCare plans in CA are currently being updated. This can cause interference with other DeltaCare plans.  Please manually coordinate when this issue happens with a different plan. Additionally, we would require a new ticket to be submitted for different plans. We would need the MRN for the plan you would like us to look into.

This being said, I will look into Plan C97 and manually push fees to epic. Kindly allow 24-72 hours for the fees to populate in epic.

Thank You.

Hi again! 




We just now noticed there is another plan with DeltaCare where the fees are not populating. Now, it is the C97 plan. From my understanding, the fees would begin to populate after the 29th , but that may have just been for C72 and C73. Can you look
 into that for us please and thank you!

Hi Esmeralda,


Fees
have been verified in epic and now populating for both DeltaCare C72 &amp; C73.


There
is a gap in the reimbursement contract from 07/27/2025 to 07/29/2025 so the
office will need to manually coordinate PT fees for any DOS in this time fame.


For
further questions or concerns, please let us know.


Thank
You.

Thank you for your response! 

I also wanted to let you know that it is the C72 plan as well. I'm not sure if it's happening with just DeltaCare, but I just noticed this now while trying to complete an FA for a patient. Here is the snippet attached. Thank you!

Hi Esmeralda,

Thanks
for reaching out to us!
 
 We have verified a temp fee outage. Fees are
being fixed. In the interim, office should utilize fee finder to manually
coordinate pt fees for upcoming appointments.
 
I
will update &amp; resolve your ticket once fees have been verified in epic.
 
Thank
You.

On review FA# 873044463 for the DOS 07/29/2025 plan Deltacare HMO - Dental / C73 attached as primary coverage and fees are showing dashes in  FA. Verified DE form found same plan is attached . Verified Epic Reimbursement page  found fees contract termed on 07/27/2025 and not yet started.  So please manually override with the FS attached here.. Hence routing to Jocelyn Scott for further review
