## Description

Previously moved to ICS INQUIRY to validate the correct payment information for banding and got response as, "spoke with Den. Rep stated the banding payment was issued on 07/02/2024 $312.00 via eft#100589824 claim#008877946003 will be the correct banding payment". But no information regarding the payment of $312.00 posted under check#100587031" So previous user moved the claim to ICS inquiry and received response as "Spoke with Mike, cross verified with rep about the banding payment. Rep reviewed and said for banding the payment was made for the amt $312.00, issued on 07/02/2024, via eft# 100589824, Claim# 8877946. Provided another eft# 100587031, to rep as we received two payments for the banding DOS. Rep reviewed and said under the eft# 100587031, they paid it for banding DOS. Since there is an overpayment made, rep sent an request to send us an overpayment to the lockbox address. He suggested us to allow 2 B.days". So checked in onbase and guar docs but no overpayment letter found and the given TAT was also completed, so created a trace ticket to obtain the overpayment letter.
