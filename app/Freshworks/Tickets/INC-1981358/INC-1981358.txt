Hi Erin,

Good day! Â Sorry for the delayed response, I just got home. Â I was at your office today and asked 2 of the FO staff if there was anything else going on in the office and they said no. Â I wish I would have known about this when I was on-site and setup the second consult computer so I could have addressed it.

The icon and evidence shows that the network is not connected. Â My assumption would be that I remember Gonzalo mentioning that he had done something in the closet to assist with an issue with another computer and I'm wondering if he unplugged the network cable for that workstation. Â If I remember correctly, I think he was helping with an issue with the computer in the new consult room. Â If you or someone has time next week, we can narrow this down and address this. Â Just text me when you have about 10 minutes and access to the step stool and we can probably get this sorted.

As for the login, the computer cannot reach the domain so it can't change users because it has no network access and cannot verify accounts on the network.

I look forward to hearing back from you and hopefully working with you next week.

Sincerely,
Mike Dyke

This is confusing. Not sure why not able to switch the user. I may have been the last to log in but I logged out. Very odd. Iâ€™ll check it when I get back in on Monday so I can see exactlyÂ whatâ€™s going on but Mike plans on coming out to help fix it so should
 work out.Â

I called the office to troubleshoot the issue and spoke with Savanah. I tried to ping the pc:

I had her reboot the pc but I still could not connect. She said after she rebooted now she cannot get logged in because it is signed in under the OM.


---


I will clarify though. It's a standing desk added outside of ops 11 and 12. Not in either op.




Team, please help IT if they call in to troubleshoot. We all can support.Â 




Thank you.Â

Hi. Sorry, I am out of the office for the remainder of the day so any of my team can help.Â 




The internet simply wont work or connect. That workstation was added in with a construction project last week. Worked Friday and we came in this week and not connecting to the internet.Â

I followed up with the office and I spoke with Savannah and she said Erin was not available and she could confirm if the issue is related to OP11 and OP12. She said she would have Erin call back when she is in the office tomorrow to troubleshoot the issue.
