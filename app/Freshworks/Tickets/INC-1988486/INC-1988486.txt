Good day, 




The Avēsis Credentialing team is currently in the process of completing initial credentialing for provider Sonia Santoyo, DMD. We are requesting the below missing 

documentation to complete the credentialing application. 



Please complete the attached Nevada Application 




Previously a request was sent for just the attestation questions and release to be completed, unfortunately I do have to request the entire state application to be completed. 



You do also have the option to complete via CAQH and grant Avesis access. 




 Please provide the requested missing documentation within 5 business days. 
















Thank you,
