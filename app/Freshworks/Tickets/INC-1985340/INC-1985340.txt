Hi Cynthia,

Per charge review Checked in Epic and found that we have treatment in progress code on 04/03/2023 for 21 months but there are no F/A found and also checked in estimates there are no F/A found. But we have outstanding balance and also checked in appointment desk where office transfer from #893 to #683. Therefore for transfer case if we have an outstanding where there is no F/A we are not able to calculate services rendered - please provide response indicating whether or not office has a signed FA on file for patient.
