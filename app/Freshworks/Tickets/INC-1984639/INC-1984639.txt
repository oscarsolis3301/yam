Hi Saneeshmon,


On review FA# 874340179 the plan Cigna PPO - Dental / Cigna Dental PPO as primary coverage for DOS 07/09/2025 code D3220 was populating correctly but in ticket discription the code was incorrectly mentioned as D3320. Checked in DE form the benefits are matching with EOB for the code D3220, verified in EOB the code D3220 was allowed less. Checked in CG the billing provider is in process so will be consider as OON but in DE form the plan details shows red for Plan Maximum and Remaining Maximum. hence routing this ticket to eligibility team to reverify the plan details.
