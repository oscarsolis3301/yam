Hi Claire,This is an issue with Okta itself after your reactivation and not a DB related issue. Please reach out to the IAM (Identify Access management ) team. I have reassigned it.

I also has log in issue with Jira, Box.

Hi, there, 
 
I still can’t log in snowflake, usually I click “Single sign on”, it doesn’t work now.

 

I also tried to use username and password; it just shows incorrect password for both 2 email addresses.
 
Would you please investigate it?
 
Thank you.
 
 

Best regards,


Claire Lyu

Hi Claire,It seems Okta disabled your account in Snowflake after your reactivation. We have to reach out to the IAM team as to why, I enabled your user in Snowflake and you should be good
