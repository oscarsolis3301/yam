## Description

Treatment length: 24M  Unpaid; $1,362.26 De- banding status: Not completed Insurance paid from banding till 05/01/2025. we have received banding payment. After that we have next payment for dos 05/01/2025, but the frequency of the payment is unclear if the insurance is paying a semi annual we  should have received the payment on 03/01/2025 for the next periodical but we have received the payment on 05/01/2025. Hence previous user has moved the claim to ICS inquiry to follow up on the correct frequency the insurance is paying. Need to know when will be the next payment but the payment was auto distributed into charges and no audit WQ found. Hence created ICS trace ticket# to validate the payments and deferred the active credit WQ for 14 days.
