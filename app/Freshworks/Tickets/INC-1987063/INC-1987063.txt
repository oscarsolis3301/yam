Checked HMO credit calc using fee schedule (DeltaCare TX Benefit Book 20240103) and found credit of $1104.70 needs to be moved to patient . Contract still rolling and since we don't have enough credit , deferred the credits in undistributed wq for 14 days. Uploaded calc in OnBase. Need to check ins reimbursement but allowed amount for ortho codes not found in available min guarantee documents. Need to check with ICS for the allowed amount of banding code D8080. No active wq so raised ICS trace ticket#
