Hi Kasturi,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1984605.

On review found fees populating correctly for code D2740 in FA#860083681. Patient has coverage Delta Dental of GA and FL PPO - Dental / Delta Preferred same fees link attached. Verified dental eligibility found DELTA DENTAL OF GA AND FL PPO [440], DELTA PREFERRED with status Verified by Auto Eligibility. Verified credentialing grid billing provider status is active for DOS. When we review the Epic EOB for code D2740 allowed and paid correctly as per FA and DE form benefits 50% insurance paid with 50% patient responsibility. But in FA we have incorrect insurance responsibility. Found in FA Benefits updated after record was finalized. Replace to update amounts. So please replace the estimate to get the correct values in FA. Hence resolving the ticket, Please let me know for any additional questions. Thank you
