## Description

As per review found we received payment from the banding DOS till 6/25, treatment length is still there. So need to check reimbursement calc but while checking in fee and document finder found allowable amount fees were not listed. Hence created ICS trace ticket# to find the respective allowable amount fees in order to work on calc.
