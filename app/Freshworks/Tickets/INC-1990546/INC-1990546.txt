## Description

Hello  
I am reaching out to you in reference to patient refund that was posted on account 04.21.25 in the amount of $740.00 .  Upon reviewing payments and refunds on patient account it state that a check was mailed.  Can you confirm if this check was cashed.  Patient state that he never received the check,  If the check has not been cashed can we issue another check.
