## Description

1vu1 server is currently offline. There was a power outage from ~ 3:30 - 4:30 am and it appears the CMOS battery in the server has failed. The Out of Band connection is not responding to connections for troubleshooting. We will need onsite help with troubleshooting the server to get it back online.

Hi Jennifer,

We are going to need some help with unplugging the power cables and maybe the power supplies in the server, circled in blue on the attached picture. We'll also need to check the lights on the front of the server, behind the bundle of cables circled in red.

Thanks,

JamesPlease find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1989932.
