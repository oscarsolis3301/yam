Hi Nick, the owner doctor came in. He stated that they are still grainy and undiagnosable for cavities, etc. Is there a way to have a tech come in where he can talk to them and fix the setting from here. Although there seems to be no issue with the sensors
 we would like for a tech to double check those as well.





Thank you,

You can compare the most recent x-rays to the older ones. Doctor stated the new ones are grainier and blurrier and can be confusing when diagnosing. The older x-rays were clearer and the shade and clarity of the images were very different.

Hi Nick, it is not the sensor. One sensor is brand new. It seems to be the settings or something. However one of my xray machines is new and the doctor wants to see if that's is causing an issue or if its the DTX settings. It happens on both computer no matter
 which sensor is being used.
