## Description


Hello,




We have a patient with United Healthcare HMO and he called to be assigned to our office but they assigned him to another office where our owner doctor, Amy Yen Chau, used to work. I am reaching out to see if Dr. Yen Chau can be credentialed to our office with
 this insurance where she is currently working and is the owner doctor.
