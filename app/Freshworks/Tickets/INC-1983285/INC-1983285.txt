Hi Muhammadomer.khalid,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1983285.

Thank you for your request.

Dr. Mina Masood already has remote access to Epic. 


To access Epic remotely please have her go to  https://pdsconnect.cloud.com/ and enter her PDS credentials. If she is not on the
PDS network (ie. not in a dental office, or support office), she will be
prompted for MFA. On the left side, she will see the "Apps" tab -
click on it to expand. Click on "All apps" , and then select
"Epic access" from the list of apps that will be presented on the
right side. She will be prompted to enter her PDS credentials once more, in the
Citrix Gateway prompt.


Upon
entering the credentials successfully, she will see all Epic icons she
 has  access to, and she will be able to select the one she wants to
login to.


Attached
is the QRG providing her the step by step guide on how to access Epic remotely
- please have her select the one that applies to her case - Windows or Mac
computer.

 

Thank
you,
