Hi Navaneethan,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1982240.



On review FA#862132777 Found plan Delta Dental of VA PPO - Dental / Delta Premier attached as primary coverage and verified DE form found same plan is attached. Verified EOB found allowed amount is matching with plan Delta Preferred for code D2740, deducible for code D2740 applied in FA and in EOB and alternate provision is applied in FA. Hence routing to eligibility for plan verification. Once verification is completed please route back to ROC FEES to further Review. thank you
