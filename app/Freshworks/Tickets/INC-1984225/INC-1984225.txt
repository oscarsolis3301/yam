Hi Jennifer,


Regarding MRN#  21616282 Kharter Simpson


Thank you for reaching out regarding Services Rendered. There is no help ticket needed for this process. Please navigate to the "Orthodontic Treatment Discontinued" SRG in Epic to have services Rendered. The SRG will instruct office to charge out the D8999.Z treatment discontinued code. Once completed, this invoice will be reviewed and completed through ROC Charge Review WQ and the patients clinical status will be updated accordingly.
