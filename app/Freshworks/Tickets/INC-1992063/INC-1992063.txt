## Description

Guarantor #800324556 Previously claim was denied for additional info, later claim was billed and ins processed the monthly payment. But we are missing banding and monthly for oct-dec-21. Treatment length completed on sep-23, but we received payment for oct-23, not sure why ins paid after treatment length completed. Already trace ticket #1824416 is created to follow up and we received response as "claim is sent for reprocessing for the banding and for monthly nov-dec-21. And also for the oct-23 overpayment. Stated as tat is 30 b days". So need to follow up on the claim status. And in response it is mentioned as "for oct 2021 issued on 11/2/2022 cashed on 11/21/2022 paid for $343.75 as bulk$687.50 via check# 90439204 under claim# 102722-00269-0". But when checking payment of $343.75 under check #90439204 is for monthly from jan-nov-21, so need to verify about oct-21 payment. Since there is no active audit wq available, created trace ticket ### to follow up with ins.
