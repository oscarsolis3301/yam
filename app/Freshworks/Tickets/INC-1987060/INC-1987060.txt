Hi Saneeshmon,

Thank
you for reaching out to Patient Benefits!

Upon review, it seems that the discrepancy between the payer’s payment and the financial arrangement (FA) stems from the provider not being credentialed with the network during the time of service.  

The
fee schedule associated to the patient’s FA is accurately reflected in our
system, hence no adjustment to the fee schedule is necessary.
