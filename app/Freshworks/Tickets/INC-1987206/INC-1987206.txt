Hi Ashwin,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1987206.



On review FA#859605944 plan Blue Cross Blue Shield of AZ PPO / Anthem Blue Cross Ppo100 attached as primary coverage and in DE form  Plan  same plan attached. But allowed amount in EOB is matching with plan Blue Cross Urban PPO for code D1206 . So please verify the plan and Once verification is completed please route back to ROC FEES to further Review. thank you
