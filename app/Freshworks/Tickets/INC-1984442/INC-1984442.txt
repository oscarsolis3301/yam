Hi Raul Macias Pulido

Thank you for reaching out to Patient Benefits!
Unfortunately, we are unable to verify benefits with the information provided on the dental eligibility form.
Please review both the subscriber and patient information to ensure it is accurate.
If there is an update to the coverage you may reopen or submit a new ticket to have it re-verified.
We do apologize for the inconvenience.
Kindly,
Patient Benefits Service Desk
