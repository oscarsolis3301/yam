## Description

Our sensor keeps disconnecting while we're trying to take x-rays. Everything is plugged in correctly but its like a cable is fried. We cannot take x-rays on kids with any other sensor so this is a 911 as we have multiple kids coming in the office tomorrow!!!!!! 
We had this issue in the past. It is the old sensor with the white and blue box. All other sensors in office usethe grey and white boxes.
