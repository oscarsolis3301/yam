Hi Piruntha Thambidurai

Thank you for reaching out to Patient Benefits. 
We have updated the dental eligibility form to reflect the most current benefit information. 
Please note, if you notice the coverage does not appear to be attached in the registration, please take the following steps to attach the coverage: 



 Open the Coverage Wizard, by using the “Add Coverage” link located in the top right-hand corner of the Guarantors &amp; Coverages section in the registration view. 
Once in the Coverage Wizard, there will be Coverages located under the search bar. 
Select the coverage that needs to be attached. 
To complete the process, click on the “Finish” button at the bottom left of the screen. 
It is also important to ensure the coverage is attached to the “Visit Info”

Hi Piruntha,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1984772.

On review FA#852211868 Found plan Blue Shield of CA PPO / Dental Benefit Providers PPO attached as primary coverage and verified DE form found same plan is attached. Verified  EOB found D7240 has debit,  and fees not matching with fee schedule and with FA. Code D7240#1 Deductible applied in FA and in EOB. So please verify the Plan attached. Hence routing to eligibility for plan verification. Once verification is completed please route back to ROC FEES to further Review. thank you
