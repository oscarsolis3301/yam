Hi Valerie,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1982875.

All 4 Patient refunds were issued back to the original form of payment(Credit Card), as requested.
 
Please Note: Refunds processed by Roc will state "check" as the method. 

We can verify the correct method by highlighting the description code, pulling the sidebar and viewing under "approved adjustment “. 
The refund receipt details will be next to "comment"(pls see screenshot below).

Hope this helps.
Respectfully
