## Description

Already created trace ticket for the true payment for the dos 05/2022. Verified in web portal found the same and received response as per rep they will send the claim for reprocess and then we will receive the overpayment letter. Still now no overpayment letter received checked the guar docs and OnBase no overpayment letter found. As response from the rep reviewed and said previously on 03/27/2025 overpayment letter was requested but it was not yet sent to the provider office and again previous user raised a trace ticket# 1945776 and received response as "Asked for the overpayment leter. Rep reviewed and stated they sent it on 5/24/2025. Rep stated she will again request the overpayment letter for the amount of-$691.00 and it will be sent via mail and fax. Tat is 10 business days". TAT is completed But still the overpayment letter is not found in guar docs and onbase, so again created a trace ticket# to obtain overpayment letter.
