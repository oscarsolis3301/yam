Hi Piruntha,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1982157.

On review FA#862181054 found plan Blue Shield of CA PPO / Dental Benefit Providers PPO attached as primary coverage and verified DE form found same plan is attached with comments as PPO-EMP F/S=PT'S COPAY. Verified EOB found allowed amount is correct benefits are not matching as per DE form for code D4910. Verified credentialling found billing provider is INN with plan DBP/UHC. So please reach out to patient and get the Employer Fee schedule. Hence resolving this Ticket. Thank youÂ
