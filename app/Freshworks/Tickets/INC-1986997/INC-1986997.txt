## Description

Per Epic review for DOS- 4/10/2024 CDT D2930,D2331 has debit bal. upon checking the previous history found the claim was processed as capitation. Upon checking Cg found provider:SHARMA, SUMEDHA NPI:1568861052 LIC: 39161 Specialty: Pedodontics was active from 1/28/2023 under the facility id#046068. since the provider is Pedodontics. so the claim was moved to ICS. Upon checking the ICs call notes responded as the claim was processed correctly and the provider is GP from their side and also mentioned as  rep confirmed that prior to 02-05-2025-provider was updated as a general dentist and rep already taken the claim for reprocess. but still same denial. hence creating ticket# to know the  provider specialty for the DOS
