Hi Steffen,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1981170.

On review FA# 572515189 for DOS 07/26/2025 plan Southwest Service Administrators PPO - Dental / Dnoa PPO attached as primary coverage and fees link not attached. Verified Dental Eligibility found SOUTHWEST SERVICE ADMINISTRATORS PPO [806], DNOA PPO with status Verified by front office. Verified EPIC Reimbursement Contract Upload page found Fee Contract for plan DNOA PPO termed on 07/23/2025 and restarted on 07/28/2025 so office will need to manually override the FA with FS available in Fee Finder. Hence resolving this ticket. 

Thank you
