I verified that I can ping the Pano:
I confirmed xr3d1 is connected to 1vu1 core and 1vu1 server is up and running. I had customer turn off the CBCT/Pano op3d pro device and restarted computer.
I had her disconnect the network cable and leave it out for 30 seconds
I connected to the core and readded the OP 3D Pro and confirmed that it shows online again:

I had customer test it and she confirmed that its working again.
