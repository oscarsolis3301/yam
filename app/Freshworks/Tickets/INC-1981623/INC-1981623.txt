I searched for the Xrays under the Patient Name: STEPHEN MOLZAHN MRN: 25883565 under the date of service/take date in DTX and it shows images available but these are the same xrays already uploaded to Web Viewer:

I approved all of the images in DTX and uploaded to Web Viewer.Â 
I checked Web Viewer and confirmed all available xrays from DTX are uploaded to Web Viewer:


Validated no images available on the server.
- Accessed patient chart locally confirming there were no series captured on requested DOS 06/30/25 listed
- Validated there was no visible request for image workflow via scan request history in DTX studio
Resolving due to no recoverable images
