## Description

PT PAID $200 CASH AND $348 ON A VISA FOR TX ON 7-19-25. PT DID NOT DO TREATMENT AND I SUBMITTED A REFUND REQUEST FOR THE VISA AND FOR A CHECK TO BE SENT TO PATIENT DUE TO CASH WAS IN SAFE SO I COULD NOT REFUND PATIENT CASH.  IT LOOKS AS THOUGH THE CASH PAYMENT WAS REMOVED FROM THE SYSTEM, BUT THE PATIENT WAS NEVER REFUNDED.  I AM ATTACHING SCREEN SHOTS OF THE RECEIPT FROM THE SAFE AND EPIC AND THE REFUND REQUEST.  PATIENT IS VERY UPSET THAT THEY HAVE NOT RECIEVED THE $200 REFUND.
