Hi Priyanga,

On review FA#854894919 the plan Ameritas PPO - Dental / Ameritas PPO as primary coverage for DOS 07/08/2025 code D3330 was populating and showing Benefits updated after record was finalized. Replace to update amounts. Checked in De form the benefits are matching with EOB for the code D3330. In EOB the code D3330 was allowed less than the expected amount with remark code 45, the allowed amount is mathcing with GP fee schedule of Ameritas. Verified in CG the billing provider is OON with ENDO by checking on the diamond icon it shows as in process but in OD General provider is active with Ameritas hence it was processed towards the OD type so resolving this ticket and manually override the FA to populate to match the EOB or please reach out to insurance for further review. Thank you
