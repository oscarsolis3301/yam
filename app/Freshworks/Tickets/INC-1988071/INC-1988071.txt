Hi satara.scott,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1988071.



In order to get outlook on your phone you will need to first register your phone as a "bring your own device" phone. 

I have attached detailed instructions to this email regarding the process for activating your phone and downloading okta.

Note: you cannot use outlook that you download from the app store. It must be downloaded through our company portal as described in these instructions. If you already downloaded outlook you will need to uninstall it in order to proceed. 

Thank you,
