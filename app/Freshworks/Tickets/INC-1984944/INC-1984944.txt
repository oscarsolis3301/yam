Hi Suriyaa,Thank you for reaching out to Patient Benefits.
The calculation of Aetna HMO plans changed on 5/1/25.
The calculation will be Min guar - (the percentage from the Aetna HMO plan booklet x Aetna PPO code fee).
Example for D3330: 860 - (50% x 857) = 860 - 428.5 = 431.50
$431.50 = insurance payment
$428.50 = patient copay

Benefits have been updated after FA was finalized. Please replace to update amounts.

Thank you,
