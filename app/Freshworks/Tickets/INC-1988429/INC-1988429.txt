## Description

Hello
On 07/16 a patient had a copay of $10.10 and gave our employee $11. Employee did not realize we only take exact change. Therefore, she posted the payment as 10.10. Then, instead of posting the remaining $.90, she posted $.99 which is why it shows we're short by $.09. Can you please correct this payment to $.90 instead of $.99?
Thank you,
Adrian Quintero

Hi Adrian,

I hope you're doing well.

I wanted to let you know that $10.10 and $0.99 cash payments dated July 16, 2025, have been updated to the correct amount of $11.00.

Thank you! Please let us know if you need any further assistance.

Best regards,Stephanie Henry
