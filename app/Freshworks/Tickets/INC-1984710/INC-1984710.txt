On review found fees populating correctly for code D1110 in FA#863406559. In FA primary coverage attached Unitedhealth Group PPO - Dental / Diversified PPO fees link attached Anthem Blue Cross - Diversified PPO. Verified dental eligibility found UNITED HEALTHCARE PPO [872], DIVERSIFIED PPO with status Verified by Front Office. As per Epic Paper EOB review claim processed as out-of-network claim allowed and paid less amount. Verified credentialing billing provider PARK, JASMIN D status is active for DOS. So please rebill the claim to get the correct payment. Please reach out insurance for more clarification. Hence resolving this ticket, Please let me know for any additional questions. Thank you
