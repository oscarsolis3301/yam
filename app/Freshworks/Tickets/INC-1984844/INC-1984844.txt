Hi Sasikumar,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1984844.

As per the review found fees populating correctly for code D2620 and also found Alternate benefit code D2392 in FA#860381865. Billing provider status is active for DOS. Verified dental eligibility found UNITED HEALTHCARE PPO [872], DENTAL BENEFIT PROVIDERS PPO with status Verified by Front Office. When we review the Epic EOB for code D2620 paid less amount with reason code 169: Alternate benefit has been provided. As per fees system it's matched with code D2150. Please reach out to insurance for the more clarifications. Hence resolving this ticket, Please let me know for any additional questions. Thank you
