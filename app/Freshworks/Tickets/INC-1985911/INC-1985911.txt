1.Checked the Device manager and the driver was missing.
if IOSS is not installed use:
\\dc1nas01p00\software\Sirona\IOSS_v3.2\Sidexis4Sensor\x64\en-us

(make sure that all Twain software and the AE Interface Utility are removed before running IOSS)
if IOSS shows this error: sensor is in use unavailable for next exposure
it requires a reboot
