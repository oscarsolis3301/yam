## Description

We ask all of our outside law firms to direct billing questions to our DL: legalbilling@pdshealth.com. Â They are reporting that they are getting a bounce back message.
1. I want to confirm that we successfully moved our legalbilling DL to the new domain @pdshealth.com.
2. I want to confirm that the @pacden.com domain address is still an alias for this distribution list.
