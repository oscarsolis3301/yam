## Description

We do not have access to the Delta Dental of Michigan Provider Portal through CyberArk and we have a patient with this insurance carrier that would like a pre-treatment estimate. The only way to do this is through the provider portal. I called the insurance and they told me that I needed to register, but when I went to register, it showed an email we don't have access to that a code would be sent to; the email shows "S*******E@ENCINITASSMILESDENTISTRY.COM." We believe that this was made per ROC, we don't have access to this email. We need help making a new login so we can submit a pre-treatment estimate.Â
