## Conversations

Delicia said she tried rebooting the pc and she said they also performed a full calibration on the OmniCam and there were no errors. 
I tried to ping the pc it shows:

She tried to hard wire the Cerec through the Milling Unit but it still wouldn't connect.
I had her check the firewalls but she could not see the state of the firewalls on that pc it just shows no action needed
It seems that the Cerec is managed by Cortex and we can not connect to it remotely and the cmd prompt is blocked so I can't get the ip address.
I cannot get the ip because cmd window won't stay open. It doesn't allow her to type and the window closes and it redirects to a file explorer window.
He said the it also keeps showing popup to do a software update. I consulted with Phillip from CDE Team and he recommended to have Patterson go out and reimage the Cerec pc.
