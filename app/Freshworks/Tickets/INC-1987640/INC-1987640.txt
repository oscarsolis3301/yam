## Description

A refund of $1000 was posted to Ronald Schott's account on July 6th. Guarantor ID 12185613. I do not see adequate information as to why this was refunded. This treatment was discounted significantly and I do not see a large insurance payment that would have resulted in this being a credit. Please review refund and clarify why a refund was issued to the patient.Â
