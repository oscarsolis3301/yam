## Description

For DOS: 07/08/2025, there were errors on the claim form (Tooth numbers, surfaces, and/or quads involved. Multiple teeth are not allowed. A7). I believe these errors were fixed. I called the carrier and per rep (Sam – ref# 2000464395221) there is no claim on file. Can we please prioritize this claim and get it billed ASAP!?
