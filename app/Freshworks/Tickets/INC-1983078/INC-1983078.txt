Hi Alvin,

You have been issued a Snagit 2025 subscription.   Your department will be billed the $26.53 annual expense.  Within 30 minutes, you should see the software listed in your Start Menu/PDS Self-Service, ready to install.   If you are prompted for a license key and Snagit was installed through PDS Self-Service or Software Center, please quit and relaunch. Once relaunched, Snagit should start as normal.  I'm assigning your ticket to Desktop Support so that one of our Techs can help complete the setup if needed.

Best Regards,

Roger DeMond, IT Business Services
