Hi Veronica,

I hope you're doing well.

Upon reviewing the patient's account, I see that all ten scheduled payments were drafted successfully after the additional treatment amount of $366.60 was added per the August 12, 2024 change request.

The Smartpay arrangement was established on May 28, 2024, for a total treatment cost of $2,212.52 (including a $25.00 convenience fee). The initial payment of $200.00 left a balance of $2,012.52. The arrangement included twelve monthly payments of $167.71, starting June 20, 2024, with the final payment drafted on May 20, 2025. After the June and July drafts, the remaining balance was $1,677.10. The August 12 change request added $366.60, increasing the balance to $2,043.70 and adjusting the monthly payments to $204.37 for ten payments beginning August 20, 2024. All payments were drafted as scheduled, and the last payment on May 20, 2025, completed the arrangement.

The $366.60 balance in Epic may be due to discounts not being properly applied.

I hope this information is helpful. Please let me know if you need further assistance.

Best regards,Stephanie Henry
