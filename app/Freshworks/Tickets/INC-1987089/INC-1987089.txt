Hi vasikaran.mari,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1987089.

On review FA#859977901 found plan Operating Engineers Trust Funds PPO - Dental / UCR attached as Primary coverage. In fees system Operating Engineers Trust Funds PPO - Dental / UCR plan not found but it's comes under Miscellaneous Â UCR plan. Verified DE form found same plan is attached. Verified EOB insurance allowed and paid less amount than the FA without any specific reason for code D4910. Payer has different UCR than PDS &amp; office needs to manually coordinate with carrier to sort carrier payment, Hence resolving this ticket, Please let me know for any additional questions, Thank you.
