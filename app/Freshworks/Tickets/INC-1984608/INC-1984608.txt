Hi Ajithkumar Arulraj

Thank you for reaching out to Patient Benefits. 
We have updated the dental eligibility form to reflect the most current benefit information. 
Please note, if you notice the coverage does not appear to be attached in the registration, please take the following steps to attach the coverage: 



 Open the Coverage Wizard, by using the “Add Coverage” link located in the top right-hand corner of the Guarantors &amp; Coverages section in the registration view. 
Once in the Coverage Wizard, there will be Coverages located under the search bar. 
Select the coverage that needs to be attached. 
To complete the process, click on the “Finish” button at the bottom left of the screen. 
It is also important to ensure the coverage is attached to the “Visit Info”

Correction in notes - On review found fees populating correctly for codes D2950, D2740 Upgrade procedure charge in FA#836381183. Benefits updated after record was finalized. Replace to update amounts. Patient has secondary coverage Blue Cross Blue Shield of MN Federal / Anthem Blue Cross Ppo100 same fees link attached. Verified dental eligibility found BLUE CROSS BLUE SHIELD OF MN FEDERAL [329], ANTHEM BLUE CROSS PPO100 with status N/A. When we review the web portal EOB claim processed based on the DNOA DN94 2025 PPO fees. As per credentialing grid billing provider status is active for DOS. Hence routed to eligibility to re-verify the eligibility and attach the correct plan to patient coverage &amp; FA. Please let me know for any additional questions. Thank You
