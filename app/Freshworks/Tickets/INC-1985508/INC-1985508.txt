Hi Esmeralda,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1985508.



The payment device has been shipped. The FedEx tracking for it is 883180562868.

I've included a return label in the package for the faulty device, but just in case, attached is also a return label.


Thanks,
