DOB on claim matches insurance subscriber DOB, not sure what the ask for Epic is here - everything in Epic seems to be correct. Sending this to ROC billing

Hi Cynthia,

Everything on the registration side for this visit looks good.  The patient has dental coverage primary where they are the subscriber.  This is registered correctly with the patient's DOB of 10/11/1993 for the subscriber.  The secondary coverage is through the spouse and his DOB is entered correctly as 6/5/1994.  I am going to send this over to billing to see if they are able to assist.
