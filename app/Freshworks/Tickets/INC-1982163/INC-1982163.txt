On review FA#861097880 Found plan Metlife PPO - Dental / Metlife Pdp attached as primary coverage with Benefits updated after record was finalized. Replace to update amounts and verified DE form found same plan is attached , Verified EOB found insurance processed correctly with correct DE form benefits for code D3330. Verified credentialling found billing provider is INN with plan MetLife . So please replace the FA to get the correct fees. Hence resolving this Ticket .Thank YouÂ
