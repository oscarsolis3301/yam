Hi Chitra,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1984611.



As per the review found fees not populating correctly for code D3911 in FA#843652884. As per fees schedule code not covered. Benefits updated after record was finalized. Replace to update amounts. Verified Epic EOB insurance allowed less amount and paid 50% by insurance with 50% patient responsibility with no specific reason codes. Verified Credentialing status found Billing Provider status is active for DOS. No call notes available in EPIC for the invoice# attached in ticket. So please reach out to insurance for more clarifications, Hence resolving this ticket. Please let me know for any additional questions, Thank you
