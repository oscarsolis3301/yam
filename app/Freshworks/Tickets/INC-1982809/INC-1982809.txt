## Description

Our office has two buildings separated by a parking lot. We just finished renovating a hallway in the original building. For years the computer that has been in the newly renovated hallway was the "ortho" computer. When the renovations were finished last week, the "ortho" computer still worked great in this hallway.
Then yesterday this "ortho" computer lost access to the internet. 
Yesterday, after the "ortho" computer lost internet access, our manager swapped two computers. She moved that "ortho" computer out of the renovated hallway and into our second building across the parking lot. At the same time she brought the computer labeled CSP3-OP1A from the second building and put it where the "ortho" computer had lived in the renovated hallway.  This CSP3-OP1A computer also has no internet access in its new location. It will open, but it doesn't seem to have an IP Address, and EPIC doesn't work. 

What do we need to do?
