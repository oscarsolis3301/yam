## Description


Hello Team,
Can we please have a update on the provider Zaid Saad Flayyih Alshammari, NPI# 1689304065, TAX ID#874617687. I called Insurance to verify the status of the claim and the rep advised me that she was not able to locate the provider by the Tax ID# and NPI#. I then provided the License# 0401418165 and she was able to locate the provider but it did not match the location on the ada form of 8393 Leesburg Pike Vienna, VA 22182. Please provide updated information. No EOB available per the web. Thank You!Â
