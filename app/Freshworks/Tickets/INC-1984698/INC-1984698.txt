Hi Manibharathi,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1984698.
On review FA# 863146802 for DOS 07/16/2025 plan Blue Shield of CA PPO / Dental Benefit Providers PPO attached as primary coverage and fees are populating correctly for code D4910. Verified EOB insurance allowed correct amount for code D4910 with Ded $50 and DE form benefits does not match. Hence routing to Eligibility for benefit re-verification. Thank you
