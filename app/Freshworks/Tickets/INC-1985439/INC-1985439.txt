Hi Nicky,


I received your request for Adobe Acrobat, and I'll be glad to assist ASAP.  Our company standard for editing or creating PDFs is an Adobe Acrobat Standard subscription of $138.54 per year.  Please have your manager reply with approval for the expense for the department.  Thanks for your help.
