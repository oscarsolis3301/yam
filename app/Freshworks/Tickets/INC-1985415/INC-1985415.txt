## Description

Hello Team, 

Attempted to submit
claim via the portal; however, I was unable to find provider once I attempted to search his name. . Upon review, the denial
reason stated: "This item is
denied when provided to this patient by a non-contract or non-demonstration
supplier. "  Upon checking the carrier's website, the
provider could not be located. A review of the credentialing grid showed that
the provider is currently in process.
