## Description

Payment received from banding till 7/25. Per review found we have missing payment for the dos 6/25 and the ins is an Auto monthly payor. Checked in notes no info found and no EOB found in OnBase and unable to pull info from web. So previous user moved the claim to ICS inquiry to verify the missing payment but the payment was distributed back to the charge by PB background automatically, so created a trace ticket to validate the missing payment.
