On review FA# 802918643 for DOS 06/14/2025 plan Aetna HMO - Dental / Plan 1i attached as Primary coverage and  showing Benefits updated after record was finalized. Replace to update amounts. Verified EOB, On further review the Plan 1i copay pays 20% for D7210 with Aetna Dental PPO SP fee schedule, the copay fee is $183x 20% = $36.6. But insurance paid 20% of the Min guar (example: $150x 20% = $30). Hence resolving this ticket, Please refile the claim to get correct payment and please reach out to insurance for further information. Thank You
