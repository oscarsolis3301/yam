Hi Jamal,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1986465.



On review FA# 874961581 for plan Blue Cross Blue Shield of TX PPO / Dnoa PPO attached as Primary coverage and fees link not attached showing only dashes and some fees are showing overridden. Verified EPIC Plan Reimbursement Page found fees contract for plan Dnoa PPO termed on 07/23/2025 and not yet started for DOS 07/30/2025. So please manually override with the FS available in Fee finder. Hence Routing to Nicole Oliveri For Further Review. Thank You
