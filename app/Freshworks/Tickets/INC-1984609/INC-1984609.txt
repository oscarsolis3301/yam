Hi Sachin Jacob

Thank you for reaching out to Patient Benefits. 
We have updated the dental eligibility form to reflect the most current benefit information. 
Please note, if you notice the coverage does not appear to be attached in the registration, please take the following steps to attach the coverage: 



 Open the Coverage Wizard, by using the “Add Coverage” link located in the top right-hand corner of the Guarantors &amp; Coverages section in the registration view. 
Once in the Coverage Wizard, there will be Coverages located under the search bar. 
Select the coverage that needs to be attached.

Hi Sachin,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1984609.



On review found fees populating correctly for code D1110 in FA#863307133. Patient has primary coverage Unitedhealth Group PPO - Dental / Diversified PPO same link attached Anthem Blue Cross - Diversified PPO. Verified dental eligibility found UNITED HEALTHCARE PPO [872], DIVERSIFIED PPO with status N/A. As per credentialing grid billing provider status is active for DOS. When we review the Epic EOB claim processed based on the Careington Care Series CI-5 2025 PPO fees. Hence routed to eligibility to re-verify the eligibility and attach the correct plan to patient coverage &amp; FA. After plan reverification please route back to fees team. As per fees system for the assigned office fees entry not found for plan care series. Need to route to region specific person for the further review. Please let me know for any additional questions. Thank You
