Hi Mahalia,

If you need an outlet and wires pulled to have a new station put in, you will need to open a ticket.  Unifed Coms can purchase a new phone for you though.  What we will need to start the process:

New phones are 169.00 each.  What we will need to start the process:

1.      Approval of charges, that can just be sent here in the ticket.
       2.      Number of phones needed.
