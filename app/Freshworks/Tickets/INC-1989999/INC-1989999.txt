Hi ariana.cruz,

Thank you
for reaching out to Patient Benefits!
 
Unfortunately,
we are unable to proceed with this request.
 
• Per Cred Grid, office is OON with Delta Legion.
 
• For this
reason, the plan is not available / Fees will not populate in EPIC.

 
The office
may choose to honor the fees associated at the office’s discretion.
 
• If so,
the office will need to attach the patient to self-pay coverage and manually
coordinate fees.

 
Thank You.
Josie Scott
