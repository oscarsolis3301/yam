## Description

Hello,
We accepted the banks dispute through wellfit but we are still seeing two charges for the same exact amount on EPIC for the patient. Were the funds returned or do we need to manually refund? Wellfit said the bank would handle the refund but it has been over a week since we accepted the dispute. The charge wasn't originally showing on EPIC but now it is.
