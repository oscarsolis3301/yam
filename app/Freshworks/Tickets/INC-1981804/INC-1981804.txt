Hi Saneeshmon,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1981804.

On review found fees populating correctly for code D7210 in FA#834013930. Patient has secondary coverage Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield of CO PPO / Anthem Blue Cross Ppo100 same fees link attached. Verified dental eligibility found ANTHEM BLUE CROSS BLUE SHIELD OF CO PPO [276], ANTHEM BLUE CROSS PPO100 with status Verified by Front Office. When we review the EOB claim not processed based on the ANTHEM BLUE CROSS PPO100 fees. As per credentialing grid billing provider status is In Network. Hence routed to eligibility to re-verify the eligibility and attach the correct plan to patient coverage &amp; FA. Please let me know for any additional questions. Thank You
