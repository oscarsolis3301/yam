Hi JoAnne, 


I have your PDS Service Desk ticket about Rachel Pierce's Epic. I’ve reset their password to: g^37A8i!B%fA


Please navigate to pacificdental.okta.com  - enter your username (rpierce) along with the provided password: g^37A8i!B%fA

    The screen will then prompt you to reset your password, where it mentions ‘old password’ you are the enter the temporary password once again. On the lines below this you may create your new password. 
    
    After the password has been created, give Epic about 10 minutes to synchronize with the new password. Once the 10 minutes has passed you should be able to login to Epic.
