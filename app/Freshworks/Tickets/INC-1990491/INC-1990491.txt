## Description

This ticket was sent by Maintenance: Visio audio backlight is going out. We just had one monitor replaced in another room so i assume this one is the same issue and needs anew monitor. If so we will need a longer power cord to install new monitor with as we had to wait on one for Rm 5 before it could be installed.
