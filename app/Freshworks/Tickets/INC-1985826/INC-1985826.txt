Hello, 
 
I have reviewed the credentialing application that was submitted for Mariam Hamidi, DMD and found the following information needed to complete the file:

 

Question L on the OPCA was reworded on the 2024 update. With that change, a "no" answer on Question L now requires an explanation.
 We understand that "no" answers haven't typically required an explanation in the past and this may seem inconsistent with the rest of the attestation page.
Please provide either a correction to the attestation page with initials and date or an explanation for the "no" answer.


 

As part of our ongoing efforts to align with NCQA standards and support initiatives that promote health equity, we are inviting providers
 to voluntarily complete the attached Race, Ethnicity, and Language (REL) Addendum.

 
 
Please return the requested information by
FRIDAY AUGUST 1st 2025 to continue with the credentialing process.

 
Warm Regards,

 
Rebecca
