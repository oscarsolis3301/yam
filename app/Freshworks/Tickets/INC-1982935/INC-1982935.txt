## Description

Hello, all production from 07/28 has not posted/ is not reflecting on office metrics. I have audited all accounts- all visits are signed and nothing in charge review from that date. 

In addition, we left the office with zero charge review and coming in today there is now 66 accounts in the charge review from April and May. We are concerned something is wrong with accounts/postings and if there are any additional errors that are happening in the system.

The accounts from 7/28 were never in retro review or charge review. And all accounts have been audited. Is there any way we can look deeper for this to get posted?

We uncovered the issue with charge review, it was the retro review now being completed and sent to charge review. Our only concern now is still no production posting from yesterday.
