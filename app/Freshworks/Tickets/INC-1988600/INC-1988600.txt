Hi there – 
Sorry that I have not been able to reply but have been in training last few days. Let me know if you should still need help.  Thank you, Greg, for helping the office in the meantime. Appreciate you!

Hi Nicole,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1988600.

Thank you for your reply, the provider is correctly configured for scheduling and on the public snapboard at #232/Santee 2.  Please make sure you are using the office's public snapboard (there should not be a padlock icon next to the name) and not a custom/private view.  If you have any further questions regarding how to configure provider templates please see the SRGs located in the Scheduling section of the Front Office Learning Home Dashboard by pressing F1 when logged in to Epic or work with your RM and/or RFOT.  




Regards,

Hi Nicole,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1988600.

Thank you for submitting this request.  You will need to contact the OM or RM of the other office (#82/Santee) to have them delete the template for the days they have it opened in September and going forward as The Epic Team/IT does not maintain templates for the field.  If you have any further questions please let me know.  




Regards,
