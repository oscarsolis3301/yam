## Description

We need to have DOS 11/21/2024 insurance adjusted off and insurance payment refunded. This is for the two crowns and two pulpal debribements. Patient never returned for root canals for us to be able to seat. Insurance states that we can not charge the patient if we did not deliver the crowns. Patient offered to return so we can finish but he opted out.

Hi Benjamin,

Insurance refund of $1200 has been requested for the two crowns and pupal debridements in EPIC. Accounting/refunds team will now complete the request. I have also adjusted the claim as unsatisfactory outcome as requested. Claim is closed with a zero balance. Have a great day! Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1988901.
