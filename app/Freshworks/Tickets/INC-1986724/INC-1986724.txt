Hi Kevin,
This is Sam with the reporting team, I hope your week is going well.  This is a DrillDown report and is not intended to be accessed directly.  From one of the Prism reports, Office View, Doctor View, or Top View, you can Drill into the details.  We do not have a 'wide-open' adjustments detail report.


There is a ROC report that is not exactly what you are looking for, but does have some flexibility.  Just be sure you are selecting the correct category on the first filter for Adjustment type.
