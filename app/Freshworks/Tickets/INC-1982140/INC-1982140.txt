Hi Kishorekumar,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1982140.



On review FA#857061808 found plan Blue Shield of CA PPO / Dental Benefit Providers PPO attached as primary coverage and verified DE3 form found same plan is attached with comments as "PPO minus Employer fees equals Pt's Copay". Verified EOB found allowed amount is correct but benefits are not matching with DE form . Verified Credentialling found billing provider is INN with plan DBP/UHC. Hence resolving this ticket. Please reach out to patient and get the Employer fee schedule to know the copay for code D2392 T#3,D7140. Thank you
