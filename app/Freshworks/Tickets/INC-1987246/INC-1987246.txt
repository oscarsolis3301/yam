## Description

Per review, Ins Overpaid $1865.00 and we have current outstanding credit of $1864.99. As Ins paid more than the Expect amount, need to work for credits, but upon checking can't able to find Fee Schedule allowed amount for our plan. So already created trace ticket# 1954867 to get allowed amount and received response. But we didn't receive proper response and we didn't received allowed amount for all Ortho codes. Since there is no proper allowed amount details received, again created Trace ticket to call ICS to provider us with Proper Fee Schedule Document with Ortho code allowd amount for our plan and Banding year.
