Hi Umesh,


On review FA#870691775 found plan Delta Dental of AZ PPO - Dental / Delta Premier attached as primary coverage for the DOS 05/29/2025 code D2393 was populating correctly and Benefits updated after record was finalized. Replace to update amounts. Verified EOB found the code D2393 was allowed less than the expected amount without any specific reason. Upon reviewing the allowed amount matching with Delta Preferred for the code D2393. Checked in CG billing provider is active with Delta Dental. Hence routing this ticket to eligibility team for plan verification. Thank youPlease find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1987151.
