Hi Joshua,

Yes I understand and I am saying BOTH refunds were processed via CC not check. The refund code "Wellfit..." is an indicator that it was refunded back to the CC on file. I also provided the refund receipts to show you that both $50 &amp; $50.66 were refunded back to CCPlease find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1988631.

Two refunds were processed on the same date. The patient received the credit card refund; however, the check refund was not delivered due to an incorrect address listed on the guarantor account. The address has since been corrected.

Hi Joshua,

Refunds were processed back to CC not via check. Patient will need to reach out to their bank and reference the transaction ID on the refund receipts.
