On review FA# 842881267 for DOS 07/03/2025 plan Deltacare HMO - Dental / 11A attached as primary coverage. Verified DE form found same plan is attached . Verified EOB found copay is correct as per correct fee schedule, but Allowed amount is not matching with the fee system and with the FA, Verified further found allowed amount is matching with the Minimum Guarantee named  DeltaCare CA GP PDS Reg 1 2025 Min Guar which is incorrect . As per fee system and as per FA allowed amount is matching as per Correct Minimum Guarantee named DeltaCare CA SP SoCal eff 20231201. For code D3320 amount used for calculation is matching with GP fee type with no specific reason code . In registration found that treatment provided was based on Endo and confirmed the Billing Provider is registered as Endo dentist and provider status is active for DOS, Hence resolving this ticket, Please refile the claim to get correct payment and please reach out to insurance for further information.
