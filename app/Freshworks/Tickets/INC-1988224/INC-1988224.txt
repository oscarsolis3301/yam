On review FA# 875613865 for DOS 08/04/2025 plan Deltacare HMO - Dental / D70 attached as Primary coverage and fees link not attached showing only dashes. Verified Dental Eligibility found DELTACARE HMO [208], D70 with status Verified by front office. Verified EPIC Reimbursement contract upload page found Fee Contract for plan D70 termed on 07/29/2025 and not restarted. Please be informed that the fees are being entered in and the issue will be cleared ASAP so please manually override the FA with Fee schedule in Fee Finder. Hence resolving this ticket. 

Thank you
