Thank you for reaching out to Patient Benefits. Unfortunately, we are unable to verify the benefits.


Please see below for resolution details:
• We have reached out to the carrier; however, our reps were denied benefits.
• The reason given by the carrier is that they do not provide information to 3rd party
administrators.

Next Steps:
• The benefit verification now becomes the office’s responsibility to complete.
We do apologize for the inconvenience.

Kindly,

Hi dhwani.patel,

Upon review, the estimate is not populating the correct fees for codes because of potential errors in the DE Form.

We are routing your ticket to the ROC - Eligibility team for plan verification. Please let us know if you have any further questions or need additional assistance.

Thank you,
