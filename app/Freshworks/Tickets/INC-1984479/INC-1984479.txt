Hi anca.culetu,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1984479.



Unfortunately, once a refund is processed back to a credit card there is no way for us to change the method. 
 
If the system allows a credit card refund to go thru and the card is no longer active, the patient will need to contact the Credit Card company for any funds due back to them.
 I hope this info helps for future reference.
Respectfully,
