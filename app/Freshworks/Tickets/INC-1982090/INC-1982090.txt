Hi Hariharasudan,Thank you for reaching out to Patient Benefits.
There are a couple codes on the paper EOB that explains why this code was covered this way.

(40528)528 Benefits for amalgam or composite fillings within 24 months of crowns/indirect restorations are deducted from the crowns/indirect restoration benefits. Refer to Patient Pays or Patient Estimate column. Charges are not covered or billable by participating dentist.
