Hi Junnie,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1986806.

Upon review, the estimate is not populating the correct fees for codes  because of potential errors in the DE Form.

We are routing your ticket to the ROC - Eligibility team for plan verification. Please let us know if you have any further questions or need additional assistance.

Thank you,

Nithin Nair
