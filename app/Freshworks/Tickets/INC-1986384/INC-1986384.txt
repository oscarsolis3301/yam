They told the receptionist that there is a program that I can run that could potentially force a fix of it until they can get here.

 

I really don’t want to be shut down for all crowns until Wednesday
☹

Hi! Do you have a # where I can reach them or can you have them call back ASAP and ask for Dr. Shonts. They spoke to my receptionist and I really need to speak to someone ASAP. Thanks!

For this issue, I've forwarded it to Patterson, as it's likely a hardware issue.

Please expect a call from them to the main office number where they'll schedule out the visit.
