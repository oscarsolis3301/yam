Hi Raghavan,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1981811.

On review found fees populating correctly for code D2930 in FA#860369872. Patient has coverage Deltacare HMO - Dental / C63 same fees link attached. Verified dental eligibility found DELTACARE HMO [208], C63 with status Verified by Front Office. When we review the EOB claim not processed based on the C63 fees allowed amount not matched. As per credentialing grid billing provider status is In Network. Hence routed to eligibility to re-verify the eligibility and attach the correct plan to patient coverage &amp; FA. Please let me know for any additional questions. Thank You
