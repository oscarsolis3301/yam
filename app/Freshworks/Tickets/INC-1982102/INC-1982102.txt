Hi Kalaivani,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1982102.



On review found fees populating correctly for codes D0274, D1110, D1206, D0120, D0220, D0230, D0350 in FA#851185896. Primary Coverage attached Premier Access PPO / UCR same fees link attached. Verified Epic EOB Code D1206 denied with reason code 6 Â The procedure/revenue code is inconsistent with the patient's age. No call notes in Epic, So please reach to insurance for more clarifications on this reason code. For other codes insurance allowed and paid less than estimate amount with no specific reason codes. Because billing provider out of network for DOS as per credentialing grid billing provider OROPEZA, ROSANGEL status is In Process with Premier Access PPO. Hence resolving the ticket, Please let me know for any additional questions. Thank You
