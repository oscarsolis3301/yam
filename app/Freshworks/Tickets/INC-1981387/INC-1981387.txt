Hi Luis,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1981387.



I contacted the office to get clarification and was informed that the transaction in question generates a receipt of the incorrect patient information even after it's been transferred.

Per the transaction receipt reflecting in the payment system ( snippet below ), the Guarantor ID ( 10999079 ) associated with DEEDRA POWELL which is where the payment posted unfortunately, the receipt can not be changed after the fact.

If there are questions please contact Patient Payments directly at 1-877-724-5566 to speak with a rep.

O.M already transferred but it is showing the other patient's info in the chart.




So another patients information is in the chart.







Best Regards,
