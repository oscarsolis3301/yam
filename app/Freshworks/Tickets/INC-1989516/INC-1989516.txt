Â ins has an expect of $0 out of that ins paid $1144.61 till 7/25. while verifying the payment found that the ins paid twice for both banding and initial records. As we know DeltaCare HMO usually pay a bulk amount for the banding dos including any few monthly payments too. We received a payment of $143.76 for banding dos t hat include 2 monthly payments. But we also received an amount of $48.33 under the check number #202501070003168 as we don't know for what insurance paid twice for banding whether we need to consider this payment or not. Also we received two payments from the ins for records under two different check number #202502040003414 and #202502110002807 so we don't know which payment we need to consider.
