## Description

We received payment from banding DOS till 03/25 and records. We have outstanding credit of $0.01 and true credit of $0.01. Upon checking payments found there is an amount of $0.01 posted under ref#587338 for 3/25 but which was already paid by another claim. So checked in web portal and OnBase unable to find the payment info. Hence created ICS trace ticket# to validate the payment information.
