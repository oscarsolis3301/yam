Thank you for contacting the Service Desk.

I remoted into OFL1-XR3D1 to check the error logs and obtained information regarding the cause of the restarts. 

Please remove the Schick Intraoral Camera from the computer. It is malfunctioning and is causing the issue you are experiencing. 

I will call you with the same information. If you have any questions or concerns regarding this, please let me know.
