## Description

As per review, we received payment for Monthlies Â till 05/2025 and records, Ameritas wont pay for banding. Outstanding credit is $579.61. Need to perform PPO credit calc but upon checking in fee finder and document finder no fee schedule that contains ortho codes in it. So need allowed amount fee schedule. There's no WQ to route
