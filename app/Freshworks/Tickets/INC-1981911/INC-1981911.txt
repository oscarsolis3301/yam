## Description

DeltaCare insurance paid $ 627.00 for banding and records and found that the insurance got termed and found that the WIP is billed to Guardian and found that the we have received payment of $ 1378.32 from 03/24 to 10/24 and upon checking found that SR is applied and found that the last visit date is 10/29/2024 . Upon checking found that the insurance paid $ 516.87 from 09/24 to 11/24 under check number # 607023386 also another payment of $ 344.58 for the dos 09/24 and 10/24 under check number #D272093783 . As there is discrepancy in check number which needs to be considered as true payment previously created trace ticker # 834911 and received response as initially claim was paid for September to November 2024 issued on 11/6/2024 as paid for $516.87  and after that there is a over payment of $172.29 for month of November 2024 as treatment was until oct 2024 so there over payment was made for month of November 2024 , so after the correction was made and reprocessed the payment  as $344.58 for month of September to October 2024 with same payment number and claim number as eft#607023386  under claim# 23159G23503, and asked rep for the payment for march -may 2024, June to august 2024 as $516.87 for each quarter, total of $1033.74 issued on 9/23/2024 via check# 605820794,cashed on 10/3/2024 under claim# 23159G23501, 23159G23502 but as the payment which is received 1st under check number # 607023386 is not yet recouped or refunded to insurance. As the payment is reprocessed and the original payment is $ 344.58 under check number # D272093783 and as the initial payment is not refunded or recouped , Previously moved to ICS to verify will the insurance recoup the payment or do we need to refund the payment by creating trace ticket # 1965519 . received response about the payment of $ 344.58 but there is no information will they recoup the initial payment which is received under #607023386 . Hence as there is no response still now again created trace ticket #
