## Description

 the claim was denied as provider NPI &amp; TIN does not match. probe with rep about the previous  ticket#1896613 which was closed as provider is effective during dos and   provider information is available in dnoa roaster .so the rep stated there is no any update found on the DNOA roaster .so create a ticket to update the provider information on the insurance end. Hence defer the claim.
