## Description

Please rebill including provider notes "Progressive recession concern. Please see periodontal chart. Graft performed on  #24, 27,28. Diagnosis: Miller Class II recession.  Less than 1mm attached keratinized gingiva, resulting in a mucogingival defect.  Gingival Recession:   3 mm.  Graft necessary due to tender gingiva, progressive loss of attachment, and root exposure hypersensitivity.  Frenum pull on marginal gingiva was a contributing factor.  Pt noted progressively worsening recession and root exposure hypersensitivity over the last 2 years. Non-autogenous graft utilized to create reattachment to exposed root structure and increase attached gingiva.  Treated teeth will have a good long term prognosis." for codes D4275,D4275,D4273
