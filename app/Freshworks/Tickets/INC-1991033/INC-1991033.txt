## Description

I have multiple questions regarding the new transition I was hoping to have answered.

1. are we still able to check our PDSHealth emails from home?
2. can you only access the new tenant using Microsoft edge?
3. what app should we be using if we are able to still use the previous resources we could at home, or how do we log in using the new tenant?

Hi Jocelyn,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1991033.



Thank you for reaching out. Please see below, hopefully this helps : 


1. are we still able to check our PDSHealth emails from home?
Yes, you are. You should be able to go to https://pdshealth.okta.com/ from home and get to your email. Same goes for all your other apps. 

2. can you only access the new tenant using Microsoft edge?No, it can be accessed from all browsers, however the PDS Health supported and recommended browser is Chrome. 


3. what app should we be using if we are able to still use the previous resources we could at home, or how do we log in using the new tenant?

To login to the new tenant you would go to https://pdshealth.okta.com/ . All enterprise manages apps that you had previously will transfer over, however personal bookmarks from your old dashboard won't transfer automatically. You’ll need to recreate them—see the attached guide for help.




Thank you for your patience as we complete the transition!

Thank you,
