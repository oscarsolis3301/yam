Hi Srivatsan,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1982122.

On review found fees populating correctly for code D7210 and also found 50.00 Individual deductible in FA#865609253 and EOB. Primary Coverage attached Aetna PPO - Dental / Aetna Dental PPO fees link attached Aetna PPO - Aetna Dental PPO - CA 953. Verified dental eligibility found AETNA PPO [238], AETNA DENTAL PPO with status Verified by Front Office. When we review the Epic EOB claim not processed based on the Aetna Dental PPO - CA 953 PPO fees. As per credentialing grid billing provider AHN, DAVID status is active for DOS. But Provider No Longer at Location (03/10/2025). Hence resolving the ticket, Please let me know for any additional questions. Thank You
