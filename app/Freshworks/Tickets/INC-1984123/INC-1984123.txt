Subject: Design Cases for ICE Orientation Training Laptops



Â 

Hello Joe!

Hope youâ€™re doing great!! ðŸ˜ŠÂ  Mario and I are looking to add 2-3 design cases to the ICE training laptops in both ISC and DSC.Â  If Mario can get
 the cases saved in a Box folder for you, would you/your team be able to get them pushed to the training laptops? Â If you can help guide us on the best way to do this, that would be appreciated.


Â 
Thanks so much Joe!
