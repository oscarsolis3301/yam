Hi John,


I have your PDS Service Desk ticket about abigail.yoder 's password. I’ve reset their password to: ?32=xZsFu6#S

Please have them navigate to pacificdental.okta.com  - enter their  username (abigail.yoder) along with the provided password: ?32=xZsFu6#S

    The screen will then prompt them to reset their password, where it mentions ‘old password’ you are to enter the temporary password once again. On the lines below this you may create your new password. 
    
    After the password has been created, give Epic about 10 minutes to synchronize with the new password. Once the 10 minutes has passed you should be able to login to Epic. Okta/PDS Connect websites will work instantly with the new password.
