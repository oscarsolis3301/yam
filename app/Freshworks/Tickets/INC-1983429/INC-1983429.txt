Yes, I clicked on the "received" buttom, as you can see I did with the other supplies. Some off them remained as "received,"  but most of them when I went back to dentira again, were showing as "unreceived," even though I had already received them.

Hi Luzmey,

I can see what you mean since you have the quantity received but it is not checked off. You clicked the received button correct?

Correction: items received after the 24th. It is happening with the order of July 24th, not the 10th. I just checked it out again in dentira and they are showing as "unreceived," even though I received them when they got to the office.

Good morning, it happened with most of the supplies I had received from July 10th. Almost all of the items got here and were marked as "received," and then later on when I got into Dentira again, they showed up as "unreceived."
