On review FA# 875675052 for DOS 08/01/2025 plan Blue Cross Blue Shield of TX PPO / Dnoa PPO attached as Primary coverage and fees link not attached showing only dashes. Verified EPIC Plan Reimbursement Contract Upload page Fee contract termed on 07/23/2025 and unable to upload. Please manually override the FA with the fee schedule available in Fee Finder. Hence routing to Nicole Oliveri for further review.Â 


Thank you
