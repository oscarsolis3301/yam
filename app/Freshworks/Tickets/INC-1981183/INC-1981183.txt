Hi Krisalynn,

I hope this email finds you well.

After reviewing the patient's account, we found it is marked as unsecured due to the information on the July 3, 2025 change request form. The form indicates a treatment amount of $1,375.00 and an initial payment of $200.00. Therefore, only $1,175.00 of additional treatment was added to the arrangement. The $200.00 initial payment was already considered when the arrangement was created on April 28, 2025.

To resolve the discrepancy, please submit another change request to add the additional $200.00, or use Explore Payment Options to add it directly.

Thank you. Please let us know if you need further assistance.

Best regards,
Stephanie Henry
