## Description

Dr. Hossieni called because he tried to e-prescribe a whole slew of things (Antibiotics, Opioids, Hydrocodone, and more) for Mike Lacey (MRN 26080187), but when he got to the end of the process, it didn't ask him for 2FA. However, Epic shows that it has been e-prescribed. He called Walgreens and confirmed that they didn't receive anything. Other e-prescriptions have worked just fine, it's just this patient that was an issue.

Hi Dr. Hossieni and Dr. Jantz,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1988627.



Here is the ticket for this issue.

As discussed, I'm sending over this ticket to the Epic Clinical team. Once they let you know that everything has been fixed, Dr. Jantz should be able to send out the e-prescription for Mike Lacey (MRN 26080187) since you're done with the office for today.


Thanks,
