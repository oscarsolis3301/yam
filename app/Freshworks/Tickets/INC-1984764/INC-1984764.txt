 Open the Coverage Wizard, by using the “Add Coverage” link located in the top right-hand corner of the Guarantors &amp; Coverages section in the registration view. 
Once in the Coverage Wizard, there will be Coverages located under the search bar. 
Select the coverage that needs to be attached.

Hi Kaja,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1984764.

On review FA#858795270 found plan Unitedhealth Group PPO - Dental / Dentemax PPO attached as primary coverage with Benefits updated after record was finalized. Replace to update amounts and same plan is attached in DE form. Verified EOB found allowed amount for code D0140,D0220,D0230,D0270,D2392,D2740,D2950 (T#18,19  is less than estimate without any specific reason. Hence routing to eligibility for plan verification  and Once verification is completed please route back to ROC FEES to further Review. thank you
