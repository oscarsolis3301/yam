Hi Hariharasudan,


On review FA#849443929 found plan Liberty Dental Plan PPO / Dentalguard Preferred attached as primary coverage for the DOS 07/07/2025 code D2740 was populating correctly and alternate benefit provision applied. Verified EOB found the code D2740 was allowed less than the expected amount without any specific reason. Verified DE form found plan LIBERTY DENTAL PLAN PPO [641], DENTALGUARD PREFERRED status - Verified by front office and benefits are matched with the EOB. Checked in CG billing provider is active. Hence routing this ticket to eligibility team for plan verification. Thank youPlease find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1982128.
