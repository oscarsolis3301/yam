I'm sorry for the delay, the downloads were taking a long time.

I do have some good news though. After I upgraded the software for PDS-1133489, it was able to open up just fine.

I was working on upgrading the other computer, but then I needed to restart it and it asked for a password that I don't know. So, I'll have to touch base with you tomorrow about finishing the upgrade on that one.


Thanks,
