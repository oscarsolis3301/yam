Hi Kimberly,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1985665.

A return from leave has been processed by the PDS Leaves team in People Services, and as a result access to the PDS systems is being currently restored. Please note it may take up to 3 hours for all systems to be re-synced with this team member's data again (which may impact their ability to clock-in immediately upon their return), depending how long ago the return from leave was processed in our HR system. 

The team member may log in with temporary password: hUj6*R7n?@F5


Once they change the password in OKTA, they have to wait about 10 minutes for the new password to sync to Epic
