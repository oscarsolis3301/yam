Hello Team, 




Can someone help us? We want to know if new dentist is responsible for submitting the Designation of Records to TSBDE or if PDS Health does this for them?

Hello!




This portion of the contract asks for a transfer of records agreement to be sent to the Texas Board of Dental Examiners. It is called the Designation of Records Form. I have attached a screenshot of the document from the contract to this email. 




Thank you!

Hello Angela, 




Please see Lisa's email below regarding notifying board of transfer to another state. 

I've not heard of this before. Is this something out of state candidates have to do? 




Thank you,

Good afternoon Kimberly,

Dr Rahman showed me part of her contract regarding the state board and notification of transfer. Are you able to find out if this was submitted by PDS or is this something Dr Rahman and I are supposed to handle?

Best regards,

Lisa
