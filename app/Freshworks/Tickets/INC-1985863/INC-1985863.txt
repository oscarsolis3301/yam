 We have verified a temp fee outage. Fees are
being fixed. In the interim, office should utilize fee finder to manually
coordinate pt fees for upcoming appointments.

On review FA# 874536882 for  plan Blue Cross Blue Shield of TX PPO / Dnoa PPO attached as Primary coverage and fees link not attached showing only dashes. Verified EPIC Plan Reimbursement Page found fees contract for plan Dnoa PPO termed on 07/23/2025 and not yet started for DOS 08/01/2025. So please manually override with the FS available in Fee finder. Hence routing to Jocelyn Scott for further review
