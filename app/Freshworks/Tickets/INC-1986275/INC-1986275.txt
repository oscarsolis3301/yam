We do not audit EPIC

Pertaining to the status of Smartpay Arrangement and the MyChart payments:

The office created a Smartpay Arrangement dated 6/12/25 securing the account for $745.50 (recurring payment balance ) which is less than the EPIC balance of $930.50, over a 4 month term with the first payment of $186.37 being withdrawn on 7/12/25,  the attempt declined.


The MyChart payments 7/15 and 7/30 were not applied towards the Smartpay balance to prevent the account from going further into unsecured.

It is recommended that the office audit EPIC to ensure the accuracy of what it reflects.
