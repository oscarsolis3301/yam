## Description


Sensor: Schick elite blue and white. I think they mentioned it was bought not too long ago. Within 2 years. The office has tried it with different sensors and it still gives that low quality image.

I am not sure if you are the person that helps with this but I remember you helping with the CBCT. I am trying to help find a solution. We have a sensor in our xray bay that keeps spitting out poor quality images and no one has an answer. I was wondering if you can help?
