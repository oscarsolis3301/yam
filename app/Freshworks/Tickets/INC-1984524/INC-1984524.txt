## Description

Hi, this patient has already received a refund for the patient payment portion of this DOS. The refund for insurance is also in process.  For some reason the charges were deleted and now the visit is showing a self pay credit for the patient which is not correct. There should be no remaining balance on the patient's account.

Hi Jennifer,

Claim is voided. If this is incorrect then procedures would need to be reposted and then office would need to distribute the guarantor payment appropriately. ROC Audit is not
able to make patient side adjustments or assist with balances or credits as
this is to be completed at the office level. Please reach out to your RM or
front office trainer for assistance if needed. Thank you! Ticket closed.
