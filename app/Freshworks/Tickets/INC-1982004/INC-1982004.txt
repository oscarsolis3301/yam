Correction in notes - On review found fees populating correctly for codes D1206, D4341 in FA#860272777. Primary Coverage attached Unitedhealth Group PPO - Dental / Care Platinum Series PPO/POS same fees link attached. Verified dental eligibility found UNITED HEALTHCARE PPO [872], CARE PLATINUM SERIES PPO/POS with status Verified by Front Office. When we review the Epic EOB claim processed based on the Dental Benefit Providers PPO fees. As per credentialing grid billing provider SANTIAGO-ARAMBULO, EMILY A status is Out of network, Provider No Longer at Location (05/10/2023). Hence resolving the ticket, Please let me know for any additional questions. Thank You
