Hi meleni.ramirez,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1989295.

On review FA# 867795499 for DOS 08/12/2025 plan Safeguard HMO - Dental / CCPU attached as Primary coverage and fees link attached but patient pays showing dashes for some codes. Verified Dental Eligibility found SAFEGUARD HMO [203], CCPU with status ROC Request Pending. Hence routing to Eligibility for DE form verification. 

Thank you
