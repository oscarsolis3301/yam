## Description

As per account review INS expect is $0.00 but Liberty paid for initial record which was already absorbed and policy got termed, Later BS of CA came active and they paid for deband records, Since INS over paid we need to check PPO credit calculator but Upon checking document finder fee schedule document was not available for PLAN (DENTALGUARD PREFERRED). created ICS Trace ticket again under # to know the correct fee schedule document for our plan (DENTALGUARD PREFERRED) or allowed amount for code D9310, D9450, D0330, D0340, D0350, D0470, D8080, D8670, D8680 once we get response from ICS team then will perform the credit calculator,Â
