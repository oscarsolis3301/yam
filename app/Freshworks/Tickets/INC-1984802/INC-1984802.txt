Hi Ashwin,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1984802.

On review FA#862677688 found plan Operating Engineers Trust Funds PPO - Dental / UCR attached as Primary coverage and found for code D1110 UCR Plan for Miscellaneous-UCR carrier fees link attached. In fees system Operating Engineers Trust Funds PPO - Dental / UCR plan not found but it's comes under Miscellaneous  UCR plan. Verified DE form found same plan is attached with comments UCR-EMPFS=PTCOPAY. Verified EOB insurance allowed and paid less amount than the FA without any specific reason for code D1110. Payer has different UCR than PDS &amp; office needs to manually coordinate with carrier to sort carrier payment, Hence resolving this ticket, Please let me know for any additional questions, Thank you.
