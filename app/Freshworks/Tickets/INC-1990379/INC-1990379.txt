## Description

The computer in the back is on the start up screen but will not completely turn on. I have unplugged the computer and plugged it back in and it goes back to the same page. It also tells me that the power button is locked so I can't press it to restart it.

Hi Erandeny,

Good day! can you provide me the asset tag on the back of the computer? Also, did this just start occurring today?  Can you also clarify what you mean by the startup screen? What do you see on the screen when it is freezing?

Thank you for informing us of the issue and I look forward to hearing back from you.

Sincerely,
Mike Dyke
