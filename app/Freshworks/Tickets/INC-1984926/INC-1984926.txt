## Description

As per review in epic F/A and appointment desk found banding was started on 03/04/2024 while checked in DBP the initial DBP was set for the banding date as so banding payment was received on 06/27/2024, checked in web payments for the banding and monthlies of 04/24 and 05/24 no info found and also checked in onbase no info there, no call notes available in Epic later the ins got termed on 09/30/2024. Hence moved to ICS to verify the missing payment info and also reprocess the banding payment under the correct DOS, there is no available WQ there so created a trace ticket
