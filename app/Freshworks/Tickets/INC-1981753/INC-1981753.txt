Hi Saneeshmon,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1981753.

On review FA# 445535638 for DOS 01/20/2024 plan Adventist Risk Management PPO - Dental / UCR attached as Primary coverage and fees populating and manually overriden with notation Missing required coverage information to query benefits. Verified EOB insurance allowed less amount without any reason. Verified Dental Eligibility found AXA WEB TPA PPO [297], AETNA DENTAL PPO-PO BOX 99906 with status Verified by front office. As per Aetna 2024 fee schedule code D4999 is not covered and the other codes allowed amount does not match with Aetna PPo 2024 fee schedule. Hence routing to Eligibility to re-verify the plan and route back to Fees for further review. 

Thank you
