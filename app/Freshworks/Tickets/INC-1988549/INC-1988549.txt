Hi Ariana,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1988549.

On review FA#875849589 plan Deltacare HMO - Dental / D75 attached attached as Primary coverage and fees link attached but fees not populated found PROF. DISCOUNT in CDT Codes. Verified EPIC Reimbursement Contract Upload page found Fee contract for plan C75 termed on 07/30/2025 not yet reactivated, We have verified a temp fee outage. The issue will be cleared ASAP in the interim please manually override the FA with the Fee Schedule in Fee Finder. Hence resolving this ticket, Please let me know for any additional questions. Thank you
