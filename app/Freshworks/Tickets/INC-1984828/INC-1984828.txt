## Description

after banding no payments and denials received from ins, while checked in OnBase no info found and also there is no call notes regarding this, usually DeltaCare pays a bulk payments for banding along with monthlies if incase ins will pay like this need to know how many monthly payments including this banding payments. Hence moved to ICS to verify the payment and claim status info and there is no available WQ there so created a trace ticket
