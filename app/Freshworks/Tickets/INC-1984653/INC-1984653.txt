## Description

Â Ins unpaid $5.20. We received payment from the banding DOS till 09/24 and records. Upon checking payments found there is a amount of $588.00 under the ref#46627238, which was a consolidated payment from 1/24 to 9/24 but we have already received payment for those months. So previous user has created ICS trace ticket and got response has there is an change in provider, so there will be no more payment after 09/24 and there is no payment details for the amount $588.00. Hence again created ICS trace ticket# to validate the payments and ask why provider change claim was not billed even tough provider change is happened.
