Hi Brittany, I check with upper management and they advised me to let you know that the Clinical Engineering Team is handling the transition from Connect Center to DS Core so the account that we setup is not valid if you able to go into your account and remove it, please do so. DS Core is not ready for any of our offices so I helped you set up your account in error. Please email me if you have further questions.

Thank you for your cooperation,
