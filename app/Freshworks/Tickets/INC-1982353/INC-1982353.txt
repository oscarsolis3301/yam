Hi Yogesh,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1982353.



On review FA#815493900 Found plan Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield of NV PPO / Anthem Blue Cross Ppo100 attached as primary coverage and verified DE form found same plan is attached. Verified EOB found allowed amount is correct as per fee schedule but benefits are not matching as per DE form for code D7230[32 17] D7210[16 01]. Hence Routing to eligibility for benefit Verification. Thank You
