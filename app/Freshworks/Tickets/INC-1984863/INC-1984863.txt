## Description

As per review, found the Ins DBP has revised as $0.01 for banding 3/6/2024 with the description of """"unbilled"""". Ins paid $609.00 for banding and Found that need to check ppo reimbursement calc and credit calculator but as upon checking the fee schedule found that it is mentioned as 25% discount but not sure whether do we need to take from UCR or not also no information is mentioned in fee schedule. Hence not able to check the reimbursement and credit calculator. Hence created trace ticket # to get the allowed amount for ortho codes or is it from UCR and also as there is no payment received after the banding need to verify that also why there is no banding payment and what is the reimbursement.Â
