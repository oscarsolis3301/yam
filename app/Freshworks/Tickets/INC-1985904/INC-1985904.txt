Hi Kevin, we can reach out to the project team to see if there is the possibility to add another office to this year's refresh but it is unlikely. A few reasons this would be difficult is because the project team is already scheduled out for the rest of the year with offices to refresh and there isn't an approved budget in place for the office to be refreshed this year. While we wait to hear back from the team, are you able to let us know which hostnames the office is having issues with please? We can see if those will get switched out as part of the Windows 11 project previously mentioned

Can we push that up to this year? There are several computers in the front office that are almost unusable. They can barely have 2 tabs open in EPIC and the computer is incredibly slow. The IT tech that came
 out said we should request the refresh now since the computers are all so old and they can’t fix that issue.

Hi Kevin, office 83 is not scheduled for a refresh this year. Office refreshes are determined during late Q3/Q4 of the previous year so we will be determining which offices will be refreshed in 2026 in the next few months. There are a few computers in the office that are likely not compatible with Windows 11 and those will be switched out as part of a separate project/visit, you will receive more details on that visit from the team overseeing that project
