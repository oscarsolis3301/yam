On review found fees populating correctly for code D3348 in FA#866968859. Patient has primary coverage Guardian PPO - Dental / Dentalguard Preferred same fees link attached. As per credentialing grid billing provider status is active for DOS. As per Epic EOB review for code D3348 claim was processed based on the 2020 old fees schedule, Need to resubmit the claim so that office can receive proper payment for the claim and reprocess with updated fee schedule. Hence resolving this ticket, Please let me know for any additional questions. Thank you
