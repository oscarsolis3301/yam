## Description

We received payment from banding DOS till 7/25 and records, still there is treatment length. So, need to check reimbursement calc and found that ins will up to $300.00. We have outstanding credit of $405.00 and true credit of $405.00. Upon checking in fee and document finder found there is respective fees schedule without ortho codes, so previous user has crested ICS trace ticket#1948590 to verify the ortho codes co-pay amount and received response has ortho code were listed on the pg.no.85. Verified the respective page as per response and found that it is for different plan, not the one we were requested. Hence again creating ICS trace ticket# to find the respective fees schedule with ortho codes listed on it and deferred the active credit WQ for 14 days.
