## Description

Ins paid $868.80 Including records &amp; for banding dos. Ins Unpaid $300.40. As the insurance is Quarterly payer should have received the payment on 2/2025. But no payment were made after banding dos. Tried verifying in web portal &amp; OnBase unable to pull the information. Upon checking history notes found Insurance is third party so unable to give the claim status. So previous user routed the claim to ICS Onshore, however the wq got closed without any response. Hence again raised trace ticket under inorder to escalate the Help ticket to ROC help ticket team
