Please credit it back and I will do a full refund for total paid that day back to SGF. Thank you.

Hi Kabao,
   Refund has been stopped on the accounting side. Are you going to want us to reapply the credit or refund it to SGF.

Hi I am so sorry about that. Yes. That is the refund. The correct MRN is 10034941

Hi Kabao,
    I see the refund of $1555.00 was mailed on 6/26/25. please confirm if this is correct. The MRN number you gave had a few different guarantor
accounts so I want to be sure I am working on the correct one.
