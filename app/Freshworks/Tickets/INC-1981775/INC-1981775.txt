As per account review INS expect is $0.00 but the DBP was rolled for $0.01 with the description of "UNBILLED" and we received payments from banding till 07/25, Upon checking payment of $152.24 received twice for same DOS 04/25 under different check # 655911929 &amp; 672731922, Per recent call notes dated on 07/02/24 "" rep confirmed as  claim was overpaid for 04/2025 and they already sent the recovery letter to provider's office and we didn't received yet and so requested it again and so rep requested the recovery letter and she suggested to allow some time and TAT- 2-4 weeks, TAT time was completed so checked guar docs onbase everything but overpayment letter was not found, Therefore again creating ICS trace ticket under #   to get the over payment letter to refund the one of the 04/25 payment, Once we get response from INS will work accordingly,
