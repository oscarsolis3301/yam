I tried to connect to the pc using the host name D0972-OP6 and Dameware redirected me to D0976-BO2 Had her check the pc name and she said it shows D0976-OP6. I asked her to run ipconfig and she said the command prompt shows:

Microsoft Windows but underneath that its blank and it doesn't show any ip address.
I asked her to check the network icon in the bottom right hand corner and she said she sees a red circle with a slash through it. I asked her to right click on that icon and she she was able to open the network and internet connect settings then I had go to advance settings and she said the ethernet option shows disable and when I had her try to re-enable it and she said it doesn't respond when she clicks it. I had her reboot the pc and also check to make sure the ethernet cable is connected. she confirmed that it it connected to the pc and the outlet under the chair.
