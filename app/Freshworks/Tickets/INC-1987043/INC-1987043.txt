## Description

Per review, Ins paid $2520.00 for Records and Banding and denied as Orthomax. Upon checking in history call notes "stated that the banding claim was processed on 12/30/2024 &amp; a lump sum payment was made for the amt $2300.00, issued on 12/30/2024, via eft# 4365738477, Claim# 24318280333. No further payment will be issued as the patient was maxed out under same provider". Now we have received a payment of $5.36 for DOS 4/25. we are not sure, why Ins paid after the Orthomax denial. Need to know why Ins paid after Orthomax and need to know whether we can consider this payment or not. Since there is no active WQ available to move to ICS Inquiry, Created Trace ticket.
