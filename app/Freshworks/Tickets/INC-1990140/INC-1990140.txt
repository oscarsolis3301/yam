Thank you for reaching out!

If your PDS Health Okta dashboard looks empty right now—no need to worry. This is expected during our transition to the new PDS Health Okta tenant.

As noted in our communications, when you first log in at https://pdshealth.okta.com, your application tiles may not appear right away. This is a normal part of the migration process. In the meantime, you can continue using the previous Okta dashboard at https://pacificdental.okta.com.

Here are a few helpful reminders:

Your credentials (username and password) haven’t changed.
Be sure you've completed registration and MFA setup in the new tenant.
Personal bookmarks from your old dashboard won't transfer automatically. You’ll need to recreate them—see the attached guide for help.


If you still don’t see your expected applications after August 1st, feel free to open a ticket HERE and we’ll take a closer look.

Thank you for your patience as we complete the transition!
