## Description

Hello patient paid us via SGF in the amount of $735.20 on 05/08/2025. On 05/28/25 a reversal was initiated that the office or patient was not aware of.Â 
Patient did a conference call with SGF on 07/29/25 per SGF patient did not have a balance she paid off her account in June, per representative could not see transaction in amount of $735.20 as the statements do not show service charge dates. But that patient had no balance prior to DOS 05/08/2025.
Patient is currently in unsecured and need to find out why this payment was reversed and she's paid off her SGF account for charges on 05/08/2025.
