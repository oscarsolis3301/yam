## Description

As per review found that the DDAZ paid $581.60 for banding and found that insurance got termed on 2/19/24 and WIP billed to Cigna and found that we have received payment from 12/23 till 9/24 and termed on 10/24 . Found that the we have received payment of $55.50 for the dos 2/24 check number # 604000942579 and upon checking found that we have received another payment of $ 55.50 for the same dos 2/24 with different check number # 600801100263 and previously moved to ICS and found that the call notes dated on 11/22/2024 as per rep for DOS 02/2024 the payment was made 2 times (First payment on 07/13/2024 for $55.50 EFT#604000942579 and the second payment made on 10/15/2024 for $55.50 EFT#600801100263) with different check number. They already sent the request for overpayment on 10/11/2024. Payment was not yet recouped.  Checked the guar docs no recoupment letter found and also checked the OnBase no information found. So previous created trace ticket #1724156 and we received response as " spoke w/Chanel. She stated recoup letter was issued, I let her know we did not rec'v letter. She requested another copy to be sent to office address. I requested letter to be faxed and emailed to me to expedite refund and she stated she was unable to. We will receive 7-10 business day, also received response on May 12 as asked rep about the payment for 02/24. Rep confirmed the same and informed as one payment under the eft# 600801100263 which was processed on 10/15/2024 was
already adjusted off from their end. But they don't know under which payment it was adjusted off. However 10 business days was completed but payment was not recouped yet and we are unable to look the over payment letter also, and again previously user raised trace ticket for again to get the recoup letter to refund ii and we got the response as "rep stated that we received two payment for the same DOS 02/01/2024 and also an overpayment letter was requested previously. Rep reviewed and said they already sent an overpayment letter  on 10/11/2024, other than this they never sent any letter in this year. So, rep sent an another request to send the overpayment to the provider office &amp; suggested us to allow 10 B,days" in this response rep stated that they will send the overpayment to the provider office within 10 business days , but still there is no overpayment letter found, need to verify again that rep will send the letter or not. So moving the claim to ICS inquiry to check with the overpayment letter, found there is no audit WQ hence created trace ticket
