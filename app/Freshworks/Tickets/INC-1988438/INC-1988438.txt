## Description

On Monday the patient came in a purchased Clinpro, which was $16.16. When I went to process the payment the card reader timed out, and had me do it again. At the time there was no charged posted on his account, so we ran the payment again and it processed. He called today saying he had been double charged, and when I looked into the chart it was only showing me one charge that was posted. He did email me his bank statement showing that there was a double charged posted. Which I have attached below. Thank you!

Hi Yerlin,

I hope you're doing well.

We verified an additional payment of $16.16 was processed in Wellfit on July 28, 2025, for this patient. This payment has been posted to the patient’s Epic account, so your office can proceed with processing a refund to the patient.

Thank you! Please let us know if you need any further assistance.

Best regards,Stephanie Henry
