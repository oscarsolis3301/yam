Hi Kasturi,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1984658.



On review found fees populating correctly for code D4260 in FA#642426908. Patient has primary coverage Renaissance Dental PPO / Dentemax PPO same fees link attached. Verified dental eligibility found RENAISSANCE DENTAL PPO [765], DENTEMAX PPO with status ROC Request Pending. When we review the attached EOB claim processed based on the Care Series PPO/POS fees. As per credentialing grid billing provider status is INN for DOS. Hence routed to eligibility to re-verify the eligibility and attach the correct plan to patient coverage &amp; FA. Please let me know for any additional questions. Thank you
