## Description

Hi, We just had IT come out to fix/reset the Poly Comm systems in our board rooms. However, we can't project our laptops via the HDMI cable. It doesn't recognize a connected device. We've had trouble for months off and on with connecting with this system. Can we have someone come out to take a look?Â
