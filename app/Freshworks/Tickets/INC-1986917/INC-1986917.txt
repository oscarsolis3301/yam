Hi Syed,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1986917.



I have reset your user account password. To create a new password, please log onto pacificdental.okta.com on a web browser with the following username and temporary password:

Username:  syed.moosaag
Temporary password:  8z?d9@FTm4T=

You will be prompted to create a new password that must be at least 12 characters long, have at least one upper case letter, have at least one lower case letter, have at least one number, and at least one special character (!@#$% etc).

Note: The old password is the temporary password from above when creating your new password. In addition, you will no longer be able to use any of your previous 12 passwords nor use any part of your username.

However, if you have any issue, please submit another IT ticket or contact the IT Service Desk at 714-845-8895.


Thank you.
