Hi Surendhar,


On review FA#864075845 found plan Delta Dental of GA and FL PPO - Dental / Delta Preferred attached as primary coverage for the DOS 07/21/2025 code D4910 was populating correctly and Benefits updated after record was finalized. Replace to update amounts.. Verified EOB found the code D4910 allowed less than the expected amount with the remark code 119: Benefit maximum for this time period or occurrence has been reached &amp; M86: Service denied because payment already made for same/similar procedure within set time frame. Verified DE form found the remaining maximum is $11.30. Checked in CG billing provider is active delta dental. Hence routing the ticket to eligibility for plan verification.
