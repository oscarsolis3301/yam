Hi alejandra.cordova,

New phones are 169.00 each.  What we will need to start the process:
1. Approval of charges, that can just be sent here in the ticket.
2. Serial numbers of the phones being replaced. They will look something like this: 64167F014024.

3.  Number of phones needed.

I am sending you the QRG on installing your new phones, which will be a newer model than what you have now.  Its still a poly phone, works the same, and will work alongside the older phones without issue.
Sometimes our vendor doesnt send me the serial number of the new phones before they are delivered which means they wont work at first, if that is the case, open a ticket for me, and send me the serial numbers of the new phones and I'll configure them for you.

Normally you will need to reboot the phone once or twice when you first plug it in to force it to download its configurations, so if it looks wrong, try that, and if its still not working, let me know. (this rarely happens though).Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1986860.
