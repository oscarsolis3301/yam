Hi Andrea,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1988449.



Thank you for reaching out to Patient Benefits! 

After contacting the carrier, we found that the patient does not have dental coverage under this policy. 

Services rendered on this date of service (DOS) will not be paid. 

Please review and update the patient’s dental policy prior to a re-verification request.

Verified this again and as per the insurance rep there's no dental coverage.

Kindly,
