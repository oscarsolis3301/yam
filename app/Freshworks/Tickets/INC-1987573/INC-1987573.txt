## Description

Mrs. Kathleen Rushing's primary insurance was not on file for the year and her secondary was being billed. She says her secondary is now maxed out which will become her primary. Her current primary is going to elapse in coverage soon and her secondary will be her only coverage. She's asking that we re-bill for the year to her current primary so her secondary is not maxed and she can continue care for the year. Her dates of service are as follows:
1/16/25 with Dr. Lo and our Hyg Vivian Pham
2/25/25 with Dr. Lo
4/22/25 PMV with Stephanie
4/24/25 Limited exam with Dr. Lo
5/1/25 treatment with Dr. Lo
5/22/25 delivery with Dr. Lo
7/29/25 CCX with Dr. Lo and PMV with Stephanie
I entered the most recent invoice number, but there were multiple.
