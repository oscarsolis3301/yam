## Description

Â Ins exp is $0.00 and found Ins DBP was revised as $0.01 for banding 3/27/2024 with the description of """"unbilled"""". Ins paid $70.00 for D9310 for dos 3/21/2024 which was absorbed already and $1199.99 from banding 3/24 till 3/25 also treatment length completed. Ins overpaid $1269.99 and outstanding credit is $1199.98.Need to work on credits but no allowed amount found for ortho codes for "PLAN 2BA". Received response for previous ticket# 17565135 but it is mentioned as they have check the onbase eob and provided the info. Upon checking in onbase eob found 50% of allowed amount is paid and 50% is processed as co-insurance but in ticket response it is mentioned as copay also there is no call ref#. Need to check with ICS again for the copay document to know the copay for banding code D8080,D8670,D8680 and records. No active wq so raised ICS trace ticket and deferred the undistributed wq for 14 days.
