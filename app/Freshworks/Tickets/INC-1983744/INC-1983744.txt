## Description

Hi team,
Patient June Wheeler's claim for D2740 on tooth #14, DOS 1/21/25 was denied by insurance as "non covered charges". Dr. Le has addended his notes with a strong narrative to demonstrate the medical necessity for the procedure. Please create an appeal to patient's insurance with updated narrative and attached photos from Dr's notes in case they pay.
Thank you
Katrina
