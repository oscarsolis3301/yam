Hi Candace,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1987633.



On review FA# 875388216 for plan Blue Cross Blue Shield of TX PPO / Dnoa PPO attached as Secondary coverage and fees link not attached showing only dashes . Verified EPIC Plan Reimbursement Page found fees contract for plan Dnoa PPO termed on 07/23/2025 and not yet started for DOS 07/31/2025. So please manually override with the FS available in Fee finder. Hence Routing to Nicole Oliveri For Further Review. Thank You
