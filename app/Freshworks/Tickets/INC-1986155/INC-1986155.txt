Hi Keith,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1986155.



Thank you for reaching out to Patient Benefits! 

After contacting the carrier, we have found the owner dentist is OON. 

The patient’s plan does not provide dental coverage when utilizing OON providers. 

Billed charges will not be paid.


Verified and updated the DE form and as per rep the office is OON. With the PT plan however provider is INN with PPO plan as PT has a HMO plan and there is no OON benefits available, for OON providers and plan fee schedule is U10FLI06


Kindly,
