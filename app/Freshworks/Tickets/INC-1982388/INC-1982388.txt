Hi Nikki,

If they are not getting internet, and its that many, its likely a switch issue or the phones are plugged in to the wrong ports, or plugged in wrong at the back of the phone.  Is the expansion area new? Has anything been moved?  The phones are configured, so the issue isnt with them.  Can you give me a little more detail about what is happening?Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1982388.

Good morning. Can someone troubleshoot this for the office. We cannot spend another day just waiting for the phones
 to come back online.  Please advise on next steps. Thank you.

I don't have any technicians here working on any building. The original building still has phones but the expansion is down, the computers are still working though.
