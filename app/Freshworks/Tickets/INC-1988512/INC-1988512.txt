Hi Carissa,Thank you for reaching out to Patient Benefits.
Fees team is aware of this and are currently working on a fix.
Please use fee finder to manually coordinate for your patients.
DN106 is used for all of your providers; DN112 is used for your Peds providers only.

We apologize for the inconvenience.
