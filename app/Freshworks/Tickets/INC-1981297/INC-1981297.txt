## Conversations

I pushed an install script that is designed to add printers to all of your online computers and delete the printers that should not be used for your office.
The install may take 10-20 minutes to complete, depending on internet speed. 

This install has been confirmed on at least one computer that was not in use at the time of the push. 

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns regarding this print install.

Thank you for contacting the Service Desk.

I pushed a command to resolve the apps issue. Typically it can take 10-20 mins but your office is larger than average, so it may take a bit longer. 
I will remote into the computer before the office opens to confirm that it is working.
