Hello Danielle,
 
Just for clarification are you not seeing these tiles in CyberArk?
If you are not you may need to refresh your CyberArk.

Hi Danielle,
Current credentials are working. No password reset is needed currently. Please see attached screenshot. You may need to refresh your cache and cookies and try the CyberArk tile again. Thank you.
