Hi Angappan,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1984678.



As per the review found fees populating correctly for code D2740 Upgrade procedure charge in FA#853457032. Verified Epic EOB insurance allowed amount as per FA and applied 50% patient responsibility as per DE form benefits but paid less amount with no specific reason codes partially denied with code CO 45 Charge exceeds fee schedule/maximum allowable or contracted/legislated fee arrangement. Unable to pull the paper EOB in Cyber Ark and On Base. Verified Credentialing status found Billing Provider status is active for DOS. No call notes available in EPIC for the invoice# attached in ticket. So please reach out to insurance to know the reason, Hence resolving this ticket. Please let me know for any additional questions, Thank you
