## Description

Hello,
I'm looking to adjust a credit to my provider, but it looks like insurance paid a lot more than expected, and there is already an OON Refund packet scanned into the invoice docs. However, the refund packet says $0 got refunded to insurance, and the EOB's look like some of it should be going to insurance. Can you please audit this account so I can adjust the correct amount to the provide, and verify if any actually does go back to insurance.
Thanks!
