Hi vasikaran.mari,

Thank you for reaching out, upon review the ENDO provider was in network for DOS 07/22/25. Verified the FA has populated correctly per benefits attached. After reviewing EOB payment, the code in question has been adjudicated based on clinical criteria. 

Please do not hesitate to reach out in the event you have any further questions.
