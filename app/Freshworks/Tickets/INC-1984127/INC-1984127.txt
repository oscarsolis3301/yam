Hi Emma,

Claim has been adjusted accordingly to dental/medical guidelines.Â 


Received unexpected medical ins payment for D0140. Total dental/medical/guarantor payment is $56.18, which is lessthan/equal to UCR $107. Office keeps up to UCR in medical billing. Recommend adjust up $49.78 ins credit to Dr. Thank you!

Per review, claim paid less than expected on D0140 on dental due to pt $50 deductible. PT did not pay. Therefore, $50 is a true pt balance. Thank you!
