## Description

Good afternoon team,

According to the patient, she actually never received the refund check that was issued out to her on 6/25/2025 for the amount of $210.67. She is asking if we can resend that to her. I did confirm her address is correct. Will you guys please let us know if it was cashed and if not, can it be re issued out to her?

Thank you,
Evelyn Andrade

Hi evelyn.andrade,

Refund was processed back to CC ending in 2674 not via check. Patient will need to reach out to the bank to follow up on refund and reference the transaction ID on the refund receipt.Â
