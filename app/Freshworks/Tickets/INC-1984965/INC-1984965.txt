Hi Hassen,


On review FA#849459272 found plan Umr PPO / Diversified PPO attached as primary coverage for the DOS 06/30/2025 code D4910 was populating correctly. Verified EOB found the code D4910 allowed less than the expected amount with the remark code 169: Alternate benefit has been provided &amp; N156: Alert: The patient is responsible for the difference between the approved treatment and the elective treatment. Checked in CG billing provider is in process with Diversified PPO. Hence resolving the ticket. Thank youPlease find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1984965.
