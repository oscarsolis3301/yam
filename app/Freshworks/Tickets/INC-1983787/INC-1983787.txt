Hi kathryn.commons,

Please void this refund from epic, immediately. I will make sure no check is issued on our end, when refunding a patient do NOT give cash. Please reach out to your RM for future reference in the best way possible to provide same day refund. Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1983787.
