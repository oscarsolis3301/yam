## Description

We had a tech out to update software on our omnicam loaner, however they were not able to finish the update because they could not connect to the internet. I need a tech that can work with our IT department to connect the unit to the internet. (SN141475)

I also need that same omnicam and my other 2 omnicam units (SN139228, 146922) connected to the milling unit at the training center.

Thank you,

Hi Sydney,

Can you provide me with the hostname to the units that need to have the milling unit added?
I will also need the IP address off of the milling unit itself.
Once I have this information I will be able to further assist you.

Thanks!!
