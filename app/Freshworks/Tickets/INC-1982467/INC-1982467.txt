Hi Maria,

I am unable to complete your request as all necessary EOBs have not been attached. Please obtain the original and reprocessed EOB for the overpaid invoice and submit a new request along with the attached underpaid EOB and template. Please note, without an actual breakdown of what the insurance originally paid vs what they reprocessed and paid, I am unable to apply the recoupment. Going forward, if you do not see the reprocessed EOB in the patients account or can't locate it in the insurance portal, you will need to call the insurance to request it, thank you. Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1982467.
