## Description

per review ins paid $206.00 from banding till 11/24. but checked in cyber ark website and DE ins termed on 08/31/2024. but received payments after terminated dos form 09/24-11/24. Hence need to know can we consider this payment or we need to refund the payment banck to ins. there is no wq to move ICS inquiry. Hence previous user created ICS trace ticket under INC#1774157 to get information. and we got the response form ICS per rep they paid $206.00 in error after the term date. So, rep sent the claim for reprocessing for us to receive the overpayment letter, Once received we can sent the refund. Rep suggested to allow 15 business days. Claim # 008351593005, Upon checking still we are not received the any over payment letter and we need reprocess the status , so again create the trace ticket
