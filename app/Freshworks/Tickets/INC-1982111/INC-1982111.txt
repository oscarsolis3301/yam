Hi Bharkavi,


On review FA#864954113 found plan United Concordia PPO - Dental / Advantage Plus attached as primary coverage for the DOS 07/18/2025 code D4910 was populating correctly. Verified EOB found the code D4910 was allowed less than the expected amount without any specific reason. Verified DE form benefita are matched with the EOB. Checked in CG billing provider is active with Advantage plus. Hence routing this ticket to eligibility team for plan verification.
