## Description

We refunded patient $1440 for unsatisfied outcome back to SGF. RM then refunded an additional $840 back to SGF for unsatisfactory outcome. However, when we posted the transactions, it was showing a balance of $600. In trying to correct it and reverse the $840 in hopes to fix the error that caused the $600 balance, it caused the account to show a balance of $1440. 
SGF should have been refunded at total of $2280 for unsatisfied outcome. Please correct as soon as possible and email receipt to patient as she is extremely upset.

Hi Sara.coleman,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1986614.



The owed would be due to the refunds that were processed equaling $2280.00, Office would need to audit the treatment that was changed out to make adjustments and correction.

Good morning, 
 
Thank you for that explanation. There is a current balance on the patient’s account today for $2280 which should have refunded back to SGF due to unsatisfactory outcome.

Patient should not have a balance.
