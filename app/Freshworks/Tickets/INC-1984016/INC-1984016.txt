## Description

Hey Team,Â 
Could you please resubmit an appeal for DOS 10/07/2024, procedure code D2740? The original denial was based on insufficient tooth structure loss to justify a crown restoration.
The provider has updated the clinical narrative and would like to appeal the decision, as the initial submission was incomplete and lacked an addendum that is now included.
Thank you!
