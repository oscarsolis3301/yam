Hi Desiree Perez,
For
the appointment counting for the provider in Prism, you will need to update the
appt using Edit Appointment Statistics.  Please see the SRG on the
Learning Home Dashboard for Ensuring Provider Pay Accuracy for additional
clarification.
 
To
correct this, go to the past appointment, use Edit Appointment Statistics and
change the Appointment, and the next day or so
prism would reflect with the updated appointment.  If EOD processing has already ran, Provider
Pay will need to be notified.
 
Please
let me know if you have any additional questions.
Thanks,
Karen
