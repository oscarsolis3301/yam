## Description

s per review found that ins paid from banding till 7/25 and next payment will be received on 8/25 since ins is paying monthly, here we won't receive the total ins expect within treatment length as per the ins paying style, so checked in HMO reimbursement calc (took fee schedule DeltaCare CA Benefit Book L&amp;E CA01-L&amp;E CA316 2024 allowed amounts since eob allowed amount is not clear) found max ins reimbursement as $1810, previously moved to ics to verify why ins paying less but no response found, so need to follow-up with ins to verify why ins paying less or what is the correct reimbursement, hence uploaded the calc in OnBase, Previous user routed the available audit WQ to ICS inquiry, and then moved as Non workable, Zero balance.
