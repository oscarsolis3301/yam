Hi good morning yanina.aguirre,

Verified the fees this morning and now populating in epic.

Office may generate new FA for the fees to populate.

Kindly note that there is a gap from 07/28/2025 to 07/31/2025. for any FOS in that time frame, the office will need to manaully coordinate PT fees.

for further questions or concerns, please let us know.

Thank You.
Josie scott

Hi yanina.aguirre,

Thanks for reaching out to us!

Upon further review I have verified a temp fee outage,
Fees have been manually pushed over to epic. Kindly allow 24-72 hours for the
upload to process.

In the interim, kindly use the link below to manually
coordinate PT fees for upcoming appointments.

I will updated &amp; resolve your ticket once fees
have been verified in epic.

Thanks.

Hi yanina.aguirre,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1986775.



On review FA# 875172025 for the DOS 07/30/2025 plan Deltacare HMO - Dental / C97 attached as primary coverage and fees are showing dashes in FA and some codes are overridden. Verified DE form found same plan is attached . Verified Epic Reimbursement page  found fees contract termed on 07/28/2025 and not yet started.  So please manually override with the FS attached here.. Hence routing to Jocelyn Scott for further review
