Re: Recredentialing
 
 
As a contracted provider, you have agreed to participate in the re-credentialing program and adhere to the same criteria and professional standards that you demonstrated at the time you were
 initially credentialed.
 

To start the recredentialing process, please visit

We need the following information to complete the recredentialing process:

Once complete, please email the documents to
