Hi Muthu,


On review FA#869415876 found plan Lincoln Financial Group PPO / Advantage Plus attached as primary coverage for the DOS 07/24/2025 code D3330 was populating correctly. Verified EOB found the code D3330 allowed less than the expected amount with the remark code 45. Verified DE form benefits are not matched with the EOB. Checked in CG unable to find the billing provider and its considered as provider OON. Hence resolving the ticket.
