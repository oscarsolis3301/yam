Hi Kellie,


Fees
have been verified in epic and now populating.


There
is a gap in the reimbursement contract from 07/27/2025 to 07/29/2025 so the
office will need to manually coordinate PT fees for any DOS in this time fame.


For
further questions or concerns, please let us know.


Thank
You.

Hi Kellie,

Thanks
for reaching out to us!
 
 We have verified a temp fee outage. Fees are
being fixed. In the interim, office should utilize fee finder to manually
coordinate pt fees for upcoming appointments.
 
I
will update &amp; resolve your ticket once fees have been verified in epic.
 
Thank
You.

Hi Kellie,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1982588.

On review FA# 873018973 for DOS 07/29/2025 plan Deltacare HMO - Dental / C73 attached as Primary coverage and fees link not attached showing dashes. Verified Fee System plan C73 is already available in Fee System. Verified EPIC Reimbursment Contract Upload Page found that Fee contract for plan C73 termed on 07/27/2025 and not restarted. Hence routing to Jocelyn Scott for further review. Please manually override the fee schedule and minimum guar available in Fee Finder. 


Thank you
