Hi Vaishali,


On review FA#859624451 the plan Cigna PPO - Dental / Cigna Dental PPO as primary coverage for DOS 07/12/2025 code D2740 was populating and the code D2740 alternate provision was applied, no deductible mentioned in FA. Checked in DE form the benefits are matching with EOB for the code D2740. In EOB the code D2740 $50 was applied towards the deductible with remark code BS -A late entrant provision applies to your plan Your benefit amount payable has been reduced based on this provision. Checked in FA was manually overridden hence resolving this ticket. Please replace the FA and remove the manually overridden charge to get correct fees populating.
