## Description

Per notes found that incorrect processing happened due to the mismatch in the providers facility name in the INN and OON networks. Per rep the provider is INN with the facility 'Goodyear Smiles Dentistry And Orthodontics' and the facility name they have is Goodyear smiles LLP. So, need to verify in which facility is provider INN.
