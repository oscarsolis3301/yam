## Description

This ticket was sent by Maintenance:Our Cerec MC X is always giving out the notification "insufficient water" &amp; even though we change it. It still pops up every 4 minutes or so. This only occurs as we are doing emax crowns. We also received a notifications that one of the step motors is not functioning correctly. But, that notification only popped up once.
