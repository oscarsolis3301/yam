## Description

Hi, 
I called Lineco and spoke with rep Charity (ref# IV2521132133) who said this DOS billed claim was only totaling $2013. They only received two codes on the claim form (D2740/D2950) for tooth #31. They did not receive a claim with codes for Root Canal (D3330/D3331), ect. The claim total with the root canals totaled $3441. As of today, they do not have a claim with these procedures or totals. 
Can we see if this claim has been sent to the carrier. If not, can we get this claim billed electronically. Per rep, we can submit claim electronically. 

Thanks!
