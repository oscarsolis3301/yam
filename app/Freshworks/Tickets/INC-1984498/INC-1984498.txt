## Description

We have the fee schedule for the Wellfit Smile Generation Plan showing effective date of 1/1/2025 however when we are treatment planning the fees popping are higher than what is on the fee schedule. For example: D7210 is popping at  $429 but the 2025 fee is $347. Just wanting to verify because the Smile Generation Dental Plan website is still showing fees for 2023. Also, pt referenced below we have already adjusted her fees from what originally popped.
