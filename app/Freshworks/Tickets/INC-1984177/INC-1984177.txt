Hi Rachel,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1984177.

Due to company policy, we would need it back so we can reimage the device. Once we wipe the laptop, we can reassign it to the new SBOS

Do you want me to bring this laptop back to ISC or can we allocate this laptop to Carrissa Lewis on Monday 8/4?
