Hi Anumol Thomas

Thank you for reaching out to Patient Benefits.

 Open the Coverage Wizard, by using the “Add Coverage” link located in the top right-hand corner of the Guarantors &amp; Coverages section in the registration view. 
Once in the Coverage Wizard, there will be Coverages located under the search bar. 
Select the coverage that needs to be attached. 
To complete the process, click on the “Finish” button at the bottom left of the screen. 
It is also important to ensure the coverage is attached to the “Visit Info”

Hi Anumol,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1981694.

On review FA# 849970712 plan Cigna PPO - Dental / Dentemax PPO attached as Primary coverage and fees populating correctly with Alternate benefit provision applied for code D2740. Verified EOB insurance allowed less amount for code D2740 without any specific reason. Verified CyberArk found patient has HMO plan K1-09 and the allowed amount in EOB is matching with plan K1-09. Hence routing to Eligibility for plan re-verification. Thank you
