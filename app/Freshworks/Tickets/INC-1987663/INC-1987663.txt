Hi Kayla,

Please confirm coverage details as no policy pulls up with subscriber ID#: 0013668450 listed in DE.

The one effective is the one termed in coverage tab. Also, please provide an active coverage in coverage tab. DE and coverage tab need to be correct and matching in order to update coverage.Â 

Thank you!
