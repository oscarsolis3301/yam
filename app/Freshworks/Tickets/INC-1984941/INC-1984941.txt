Hi Rajan,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1984941.



On review FA#844470718 found plan Employer Driven Insurance Services PPO - Dental / UCR attached as Primary coverage. Code D4910 fee overridden and Deductible is applied in FA and in EOB. In fees system Employer Driven Insurance Services PPO - Dental / UCR plan not found but it's comes under Miscellaneous  UCR plan. Verified DE form found same plan is attached. Verified EOB insurance allowed and paid less amount than the FA without any specific reason for code D4910. Payer has different UCR than PDS &amp; office needs to manually coordinate with carrier to sort carrier payment, Hence resolving this ticket, Please let me know for any additional questions, Thank you.
