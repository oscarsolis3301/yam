## Description

Hi team,
While auditing patient account, found error in codes utilized to bill out implant bridge on DOS 4/25/25. Provider corrected codes to D6068*2 and D6075*2 respectively to reflect the true scope of the work. Therefore, please re-submit to insurance claim for DOS 4/25/25 with corrected codes.
Thank you
