Hi Murugapriya,


On review FA#856221904 the plan Cigna PPO - Dental / Cigna Dental PPO as primary coverage for DOS 07/08/2025 with Benefits updated after record was finalized. Replace to update amounts. Checked in DE form the benefits are not matching with EOB for the code D6010. Verified in EOB the code D6010 was allowed as per the fee schedule and $50 was applied towards the deductible, checked in CG the billing provider is active for the DOS. Hence routing this ticket to eligibility team for benefit verification and route back to fees team for further review. Thank you.
