Hello Tiffany, 

 

Yes, we had an issue where this office was opened with the incorrect tin information, it should've never been the TIN you have listed currently. The correct tin number for this location is 93-2331125. 

 

Thank you!

Good morning, Is this for 812 Muddy Branch Road Gaithersburg, MD 20878? If so, this location is already credentialed under a different tax ID number. Would this be a tax ID number change or a practice sale? For more information about our Medicare

Good Afternoon,

 

Would it be possible to start the process for the owner doctor to credential the office? I was looking for the group agreement but was unable to locate couldn’t recall if this was the docusign one or a separate contract.

 

Thank you!
