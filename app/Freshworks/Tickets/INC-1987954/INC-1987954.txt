Hi Adrian,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1987954.

Hello, 

We have fixed the deposit date for this payment. It will still show a discrepancy in the smart dash because a change was made. We can not fix that. If any changes are made, it will always show a discrepancy. Everything should settle by end of month.

Please feel free to reach out with any further questions or concerns. 

Thank you

Hello,, 
We can not change the date that you made the deposit. We can change the date in EPIC so it will match the day you deposited. Would you like for us to change the date to 7/30?
