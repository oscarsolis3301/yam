## Description

I am making this request on behalf of Cory Bird. He is out of the office and can not get his laptop to connect to WiFi which means he cant get on Box or his emails. His background changed on the main screen so it seems that his computer may have updated or restart...not sure. He gets an error message when he tries to connect to WiFi which I have attached. 

He can try to be in the office tomorrow around 2 (flights permitting) if this needs to be handled in person. He is traveling to Irvine to train a new team member on Monday and needs this handled as soon as possible.

Thank you,

Hi Cory,I tried to call and understand you may be traveling at this time. I'm unable to see the attached images due to file incompatibility. Based on the details, it sounds like your laptop may have updated to Windows 11 as part of corporate operation requirements. When you have a chance, can you provide further information on what happens when trying to connect to WiFi?For expedited service, please call the Service Desk at (714) 845-8895 so we can provide assistance as soon as possible. If you're at DSC, let me know and I'll stop by to review this issue in person.If you have any questions then let me know.Warm regards,SeanPlease find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1987681.
