Hi Keri-Anna,

I did some research into the account lockout issue you've been experiencing. 
Based on the findings, it appears that the lockouts may be related to your credentials being used to access the internet when you're in the office.
If your cell phone is connected to the "PDS TEAMS" Wi-Fi network, please ensure that your saved password is updated to match your current credentials. 
When the device attempts to automatically connect using outdated login information, it can trigger repeated authentication failures, ultimately leading to your account being locked.

In Epic, I observed a pattern of five failed login attempts, followed by one successful attempt. 
This indicates that incorrect credentials are being repeatedly entered.
I attempted to reach you by phone to explain the situation, but after being placed on hold, the call was not resumed.
Please let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance—I'm happy to help.

Best regards,
