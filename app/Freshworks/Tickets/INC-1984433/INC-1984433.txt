Thanks for testing that out Tami, the one other thing to check would be the actual handset cable. Not sure if this has already been tested, but could you try swapping the handset cord with a known working one to confirm if it may be the culprit ?Thank you!

I just tried it since you said that.  It does work on other phones so it is not the headset

Hi Tami &amp; Samuel,

Have we tried replacing just the headset on the current phone with a known working one, just to see if maybe the headset piece may be the issue ?
