Hi Nancy,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1981316.

As per request need to rebill Cigna PPO for DOS 08/26/2023. So Upon checking on cigna portal for Dental Plan patient is active from only 12/01/2023 and the DOS is on 08/26/2023. So if we submit to insurance also they will not paid for DOS 08/26/2023. So kindly please review and let us know for further processing. Thank you.
