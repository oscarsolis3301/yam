I went onsite and found that the APC was fully functional with good battery, however there was nothing connected to it. I checked the cables and found one server power cable was connected to the TrippLite and the other one in the Watt Box. I went to move the cable from the Watt Box to the APC unit but upon removing the cable the server went down, I then reconnected the cable. Next I moved the cable connected to the TrippLite to a different power outlet then I moved the cable from the Watt Box to the APC and the power held up. After the change 1 server power cable was connected to the TrippLite and 1 to the APC unit, James Foster was able to verify both server PSUs were functioning as normal.

Contacted Rustan for more information as it looks like an APC Battery was not ordered, pending response.
