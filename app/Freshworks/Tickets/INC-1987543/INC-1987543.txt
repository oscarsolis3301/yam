## Description

Hello,

I'm following up regarding my ticket yesterday (ticket #1986253) According to our epic report today the payment has been voided. Please see the attached file. 

Can you please confirm if this payment went through and has been posted on our collections? Our report says otherwise but we don't know how accurate this is.

thank you

Hi Cherrie,
Yes the full amount of $9313.00 would be voided since the amount does not technically exist anymore due to it being split into two different amounts because of the transfer. Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1987543.
