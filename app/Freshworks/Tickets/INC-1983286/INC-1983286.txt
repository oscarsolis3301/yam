Good morning,


 


I had a new patient bring in insurance information showing me as an in-network PDS Provider for Sienna Modern Dentistry and Sugar Land Modern Dentistry on their insurance registry. 




This needs to be fixed ASAP as I have not been a provider at these locations in 24+ months and am no longer an employee/provider with PDS. 


 


Please advise on when this is submitted and completed. 


 


Best,

Good morning, 
 
Please see the recent email from Dr. Aaron Gavri. He’s being told that he’s still listed on our office directory. How can we assure him that this has been resolved since this conversation with MetLife took place yesterday?

 
Thank you,
