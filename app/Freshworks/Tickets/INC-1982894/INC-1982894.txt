Hi Hannah,

As a dental hygienist you aren't able to remove orders, either the OM or a dentist will need to help you remove this order. I went ahead and removed the duplicate order, in the future you can have the dentist or OM remove this for you.Â Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1982894.
