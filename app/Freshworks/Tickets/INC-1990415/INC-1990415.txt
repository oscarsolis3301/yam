  Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System (AHCCCS) requires you to revalidate your Medicaid Enrollment information by 08/31/2025. If you do not revalidate by 08/31/2025 AHCCCS will terminate your enrollment.        All providers in the AHCCCS Medicaid Program must revalidate as a condition of participation in the Medicaid program under the terms of the Provider Participation Agreement, AHCCCS Medical Policy Manual (AMPM) chapter 610, and 42 C.F.R. § 455.414.  Failure to revalidate by 08/31/2025 will result in the termination of your enrollment with the AHCCCS Medicaid Program.     
If you recently submitted a modification request that was pending with AHCCCS for review, it is no longer pending. You must return to the AHCCCS Provider Enrollment Portal (APEP), review and submit a complete revalidation application. The information previously submitted as a modification has been retained and can be confirmed or updated during the revalidation process.
  For step-by-step training tutorials on the APEP system please visit http://www.azahcccs.gov/APEP. The training is listed as APEP Training Instructional Tutorials, please review this training prior to accessing APEP.       
Completing revalidation in APEP:
You must complete the revalidation process and make sure all information is correct.  To complete the revalidation process you must: 
1.	Log into APEP.  
2.	Under the Provider Tab, click on the "Manage Provider Information" link to find your application.  
3.	Respond to all steps that are marked as "Incomplete" before submitting application.   
4.	Upload any required documentation such as current license/certification and W-9 signed in the last 12 months. 
5.	Sign the electronic Provider Participation Agreement; and   
6.	Submit the revalidation application for State approval. 
NOTE: You must complete ALL application steps through step 12 to fully submit the revalidation application. When the revalidation is submitted, you will see a red message at the top of the screen that says the application has been submitted for review. 
    You may also be required to submit an enrollment fee, be subject to a site visit, or perform a fingerprint criminal background check in accordance with Section 6401 of the Affordable Care Act and 42 CFR 455, Subpart E., Separate notification will be sent if your provider type requires one of these actions.     		
If you have any questions, you may:		        Email Lisa Quihuis, APEPtrainingQuestions@azahcccs.gov; or        Call Provider Services at 602-417-7670.					  Sincerely,

AHCCCS Division of Member and Provider Services
