Hi Murugapriya,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1984696.

On review FA# 852285996 for DOS 07/03/2025 plan Delta Health Systems PPO / Anthem Blue Cross Prudent Buyer and code D3911 is populating the Target fee. Verified EOB insurance allowed payment as plan Anthem Blue CRoss PPO100 and code D3911 is not covered so insurance allowed payment as per their own FS. Verified Credentialing status Billing provider Sandeep Chunduru is OON. Hence routing to Eligibility to re-verify the plan attached. 

Thank you
