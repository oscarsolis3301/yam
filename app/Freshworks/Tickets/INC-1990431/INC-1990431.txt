## Description

Hello,
I'm not sure what department this is supposed to go to. However, we have a new provider who started seeing patients as of 07/21. All of his encounters in Epic are closed but his production is not reflecting in the MyOffice page. Can you please help us fix this issue. Please let me know if there is anything needed from our end.
Thank you,
Adrian Quintero
