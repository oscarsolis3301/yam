## Description

I am trying to download the new okta verification. I was able to on my phone but I am not sure if i set it up correctly. I was able to follow most of the instructions but got stuck step 8 with the QR code. I am not finding one. Alos it says there should be 2 accounts listed on the okta verify app, I only have one. I also cannot figure out the set up SMS or voice call verification.
