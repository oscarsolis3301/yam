Hi nidia.vargas,

Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1985359.

Thank you for your ticket request. We have reviewed the patient account per your request. Per our review, the patient banded on 12/06/2024 for 30M. As per checking they charge out start code on 12/06/2024 later they voided. Found Ins paid for DOS12/06/2024 for banding $430.00 and remaining unpaid amount, they created CJ plan$1570.00. That will show huge patient balance. So. Requesting office to confirm whether the pt banded on 12/06/2024 or not. If it yes please charge out start code on 12/06/2024. Once info is provided, we will adjust the account accordingly.

Thank you,
Have a great day!
