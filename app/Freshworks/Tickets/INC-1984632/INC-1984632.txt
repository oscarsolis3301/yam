Thank you for reaching out to Patient Benefits.

Once in the Coverage Wizard, there will be Coverages located under the search bar. 
Select the coverage that needs to be attached.

Hi Vaishali,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1984632.




On review found fees populating correctly for codes D1206, D1120 in FA#859570244. Patient has primary coverage Unitedhealth Group PPO - Dental / Care Platinum Series PPO/POS fees link attached Careington - Care Platinum Series PPO/POS. Verified dental eligibility found UNITED HEALTHCARE PPO [872], CARE PLATINUM SERIES PPO/POS with status Completed - ROC. When we review the web portal EOB for codes D1206, D1120 claim processed based on the Dental Benefit Providers PPO fees. As per credentialing grid billing provider status is In Process but as per EOB status is In Network. Hence routed to eligibility to re-verify the eligibility and attach the correct plan to patient coverage &amp; FA. After plan reverification please route back to fees team. As per fees system for the assigned office fees entry not updated for some codes. Need to route to region specific person for the further review. Please let me know for any additional questions. Thank You
