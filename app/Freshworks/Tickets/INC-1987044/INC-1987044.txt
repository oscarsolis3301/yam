## Description

We received payment from banding DOS till 7/25. So, need to check reimbursement calc but there is a discrepancy between the co-pay amount for banding. Checked in De form and remit found that banding co-pay is $1000.00 but per fees schedule it is $1600.00. While calculating reimbursement entered $1000.00 to verify and ins is paying correctly for 24 months with a reimbursement amount of $1150.00 and by entering $1600.00 reimbursement is $550.00. Hence created ICS trace ticket# to verify the co-pay amount for the banding code D8080
