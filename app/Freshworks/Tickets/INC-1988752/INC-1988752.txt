Hi Mary,

Unable to complete request due to account is already been finalized for dismissal - see per review office also needing to charge out misc ortho procedure with fee of $750 attached however see per  charge review no balance listed with code charged out. 

Since office is needing to correct code and fee associated office will need to charge out restart code for same date of service corrected code will be charged out under, once completed team will then reinstate, recomplete, and post code - if account needs to be placed under dismissal status again office will then need to charge out treatment discontinue code once more. Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1988752.
