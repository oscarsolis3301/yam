## Description

Hello,
Patient Patricia Jeffries (GUAR ID: 23141690) currently has an unsecured balance of $956. While auditing her account, I noticed that Christina Ruiz voided a $1,074 Care Credit payment, citing that no receipt was scanned in.
However, upon reviewing the patient's guarantor documents, I found that the receipt is scanned in. The payment was made using her spouse Carson Jeffries' Care Credit account. Additionally, the insurance portion has already been paid.
Could someone please assist in reviewing and correcting this? Iâ€™ve attached screenshots from the guarantor file for reference.
Thank you!

Thank you for the update. I am confused, the $1848 covers the root canal and crown. Insurance paid their portion, should the void be reversed?
