## Description

As per review, found the Ins DBP has revised as $0.01 for banding 11/8/2024 with the description of """""""""unbilled"""""""""". Also we got a payment for banding and found that there is no dnl as of now . As per update need to check reimbursement and credit calculator but upon checking there is no copay amount to calculate the reimbursement and credit and also checked the other year copay schedule there is no ortho codes in the copay schedule for the plan CLI . Hence not able to check the reimbursement and credit calculator. Therefore, raised an fee schedule ticket #
