## Description

We have been having issues with our CAD/CAM camera when trying to scan when working with patients. We have checked the camera connection and it seems to still be plugged in, and the sleeve on the camera head has been changed. We have been having issues calibrating it though for it states the calibration is cancelled once getting to the final step.
