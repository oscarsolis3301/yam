## Description

Our CadCam is saying that our battery capacity is under 15. An alarm just went on saying that the battery is at critical low. Our cadcam is always plugged in. I made sure the cable was not loose. I turned the machine completely off and turned it back on. And it still gave the battery issueÂ
