Initially EMI Health
PPO was active on banding and paid from banding till 09/01/2024 then coverage
was termed but in between we do not have payments for dos 09/23, 10/23, 12/23,
02/24, 05/24. As per review in all payor report found that insurance is an auto
payor. But we do not have payments for these months previously there is no
follow up's for these missing amount. There is no wq found for EMI health PPO
in EPIC. Hence creating a trace help ticket to follow up on these missing
payments.
