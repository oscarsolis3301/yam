Hi Rajan,


On review FA#856843017 the plan Metlife PPO - Dental / Metlife Pdp is primary coverage for DOS 07/15/2025 code D7210 was populating correctly with deductible $50 in FA. Checked in De form the benefits are not matching with EOB for the code D7210. In EOB the  code D7210 was allowed as per the fee schedule with $50 applied towards the deductible but the benefits are not matching. Checked in CG the provider is  INN with Metlife hence routing this ticket to eligibility team for benefit reverification.
