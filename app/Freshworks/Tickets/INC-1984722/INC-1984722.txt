On review FA# 850317144 for DOS 07/01/2025 plan Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield of NV PPO / Anthem Blue Cross Ppo100 attached as Primary coverage and fees are populating correctly for code D2740 with Alternate Benefit Provision and PD applied. Verified EOB insurance allowed less amount for code D2740 without any specific reason code. Verified Credentialing status found Billing Provider is INN with Blue Cross. Hence routing to Eligibility to re-verify the plan attached. 

Thank you
