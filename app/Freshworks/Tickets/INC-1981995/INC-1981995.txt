Hi Sachin,

Upon further review I found Pedo provider is INN with Aetna HMO, the DOS is 07/14/2025 and the fees were updated to reflect 2025 fees on7/15/2025.

additionally, the insurance is paying 20% of the min guar instead of the correct amount. Attaching fee schedule and advising to resubmit the claim.

Thank You.
Josie Scott

On review FA# 860183171 for DOS 07/14/2025 plan Aetna HMO - Dental / Plan Lba attached as Primary coverage and  showing Benefits updated after record was finalized. Replace to update amounts. Verified EOB  On further review the Plan 2ba copay pays 20% for D7140 with Aetna Dental PPO GP fee schedule, the copay fee is $281 x 20% = $17.2. But insurance paid 20% of the Min guar (example: $200*20% = $40). 
 
 
For Code D1510 copay is $0 as per Fee schedule but insurance paid as per 50%. Hence Routing to Jocelyn Scott For further review. Thank You
