As per the review found fees populating correctly for codes D2950, D2740 Upgrade procedure charge in FA#859684701. Benefits updated after record was finalized. Replace to update amounts. Verified dental eligibility found UNITED HEALTHCARE PPO [872], DIVERSIFIED PPO with status ROC Request Pending. For code D2740 benefit 60% insurance responsibility frequency limit 1/60M code Downgraded. As per credentialing grid billing provider status is active for DOS with Diversified Dental Services. In Process with UHC PPO. When we review the EPIC EOB for code D2740 paid less amount with reason code 169: Alternate benefit has been provided. Verified PPO Maximizer D2791 listed as downgrade code but EOB payment matched with code D2752. For code D2950 paid less with reason code 250 The attachment/other documentation content received is inconsistent with the expected content.
