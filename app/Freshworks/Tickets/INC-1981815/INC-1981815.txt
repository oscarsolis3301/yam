Hi Vivek Christopher

Thank you for reaching out to Patient Benefits. 
We have updated the dental eligibility form to reflect the most current benefit information. 
Please note, if you notice the coverage does not appear to be attached in the registration, please take the following steps to attach the coverage: 



 Open the Coverage Wizard, by using the “Add Coverage” link located in the top right-hand corner of the Guarantors &amp; Coverages section in the registration view. 
Once in the Coverage Wizard, there will be Coverages located under the search bar. 
Select the coverage that needs to be attached.

Hi Vivek,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1981815.



Upon reviewing FA#848189114, the plan Oregon Dental Services PPO / Delta Premier is attached as the primary coverage, as reflected in both the FA and the DE form. The FA under "Query Benefits" indicates an annual insurance limit of $2,200.00. This matches the paper EOB, which shows that the total benefits of $2,200 have been met—$2,178 was paid to the provider, and $22 was withheld. Credentialing verification confirms that the billing provider is in-network (INN) with the Delta Premier plan. However, in paper EOB found that the insurance paid less than the estimated amount for codes D9223 (x2) and D9222, without a specific reason. For codes D9223 (x2), D9222, and D7240 (1,16), the reason listed is 9A8 – “The charge exceeds the amount allowed.” Additionally, the DE form was found to have incomplete benefits information attached. Hence Routing to Eligibility to update the DE form with correct benefits . Thank You
