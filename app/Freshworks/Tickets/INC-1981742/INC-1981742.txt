Hi Chitra,


On review FA#863273766 the plan  Humana PPO - Dental / Care Platinum Series PPO/POS as primary coverage for DOS 07/16/2025 code D1351 was populating correctly. checked in De form the benefits are matching with EOB for the code D1351. In EOB the code D1351 was allowed less with remark code 45. Verified in CG the billing provider is OON with Humana and Careington hence resolving this ticket and please reach out to insurance for further review.
