## Description

Joe called because there are two sensor boxes in the office that are having issues. When a sensor is plugged into them, it won't show up until they wiggle the sensor cable into the perfect position, and then they'll work just fine. They've tried the same sensors that don't work on these sensor boxes on different sensor boxes that don't have these issues, and they work totally fine. So, the issue pertains to the sensor boxes.Serial Numbers for the two sensor boxes with this issue20430472033473
