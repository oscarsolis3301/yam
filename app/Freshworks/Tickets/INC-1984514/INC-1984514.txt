## Description



Hello Team,

Please review the payment $ 4,870.00 posted on 3/4/2025 by patient payments.
Is this a true payment? The transaction ID is the same as the payment on 2/3/2025, same amount.

Please confirm, the patient filed a dispute because this card was charged double? Office did not charge the card on 3/4/25. Need clarification. Â did this pt get charged twice?
