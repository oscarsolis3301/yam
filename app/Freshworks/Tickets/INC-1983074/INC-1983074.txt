## Description

Hi Team
The computer in Operatory #2 continues to black out, while GP/Hyg are in the room with patients. The system continues to log out and requires a EPIC 2 login and password, which no one in office has info on. We are a new team in this practice and would like to have this issue addressed. Due to these issues providers are unable to displace nor review with patients their x-rays, plus HC is unable to review FA with patients.
Thanks
