## Description

Dr. Matthew Yip has requested that we refund a patient for treatment that occurred in QSI on March 5, 2021. The patient has had continual issues with this restoration and tooth since the treatment occurred.  The patient is a long standing patient of Dr. Yip, so he has requested that the patient be reimbursed for the Root Canal, Crown and Build/Up that occurred on March 5, 2021 that total $1611.00.  This transaction occurred in QSI so I am unable to complete on my end. My regional back office trainer suggested opening a ticket to get the balance moved into EPIC so that a refund could be processed.
