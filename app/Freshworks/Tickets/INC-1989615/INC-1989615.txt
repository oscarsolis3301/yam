Hi Aswathy Vijayan

Thank you for reaching out to Patient Benefits. 
We have updated the dental eligibility form to reflect the most current benefit information. 
Please note, if you notice the coverage does not appear to be attached in the registration, please take the following steps to attach the coverage: 



 Open the Coverage Wizard, by using the “Add Coverage” link located in the top right-hand corner of the Guarantors &amp; Coverages section in the registration view. 
Once in the Coverage Wizard, there will be Coverages located under the search bar. 
Select the coverage that needs to be attached. 
To complete the process, click on the “Finish” button at the bottom left of the screen. 
It is also important to ensure the coverage is attached to the “Visit Info”

Hi Aswathy,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1989615.



On review found fees populating correctly for code D4910 in FA#828475918. Patient has coverage Blue Cross Blue Shield of MN Federal / Anthem Blue Cross Ppo100 fees link attached Anthem Blue Cross - Anthem Blue Cross PPO100. Verified dental eligibility found BLUE CROSS BLUE SHIELD OF MN FEDERAL [329], ANTHEM BLUE CROSS PPO100 with status ROC Request Pending. When we review the Epic EOB claim processed based on the DNOA PPO fees. As per credentialing grid billing provider status is active for DOS. Hence routed to eligibility to re-verify the eligibility and attach the correct plan to patient coverage &amp; FA. Please let me know for any additional questions. Thank You
