Hi Bharkavi,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1982119.

On review found fees populating correctly for code D4341 in FA#850913955. Patient has coverage United Concordia Addp Federal - Dental / Tricare (Retiree/Family) same fees link attached United Concordia - ADDP - ADDP Reg 18. Verified dental eligibility found UNITED CONCORDIA MILITARY FEDERAL [862], TRICARE (RETIREE/FAMILY) with status Verified by Auto Eligibility. When we review the Epic EOB claim processed based on the ADDP Reg 18 fees allowed amount and paid correctly as per DE form benefits 60% insurance paid with 40% patient responsibility. In FA we have the incorrect insurance responsibility as 100% for code D4341. Benefits in the DE form were updated after record was finalized.
