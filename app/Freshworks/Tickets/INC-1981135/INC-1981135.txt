Hi Kathryn,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1981135.

Per review ticket as foud payment $64.15 collected by office from patient on visit 07/28/2025 but for dos 10/17/2024 total claim amoint piad is $97.20“MRN#_14226789 INV_A34710265401 DOS_10/17/2024 INS_DELTA TRICARE FEDERAL Per EOB Insurance paid a 
total of $97.20 to the subscriber. The office only collected/posted $64.15 on 07/28/2025. Please reach out to the 
subscriber to collect the remaining $33.05. Not collecting the total OON insurance payment can cause. 
(1) An inability to give unexpected production to the providers. (2) Allows the patient to keep 
overpayment that is due to the insurance. (3) Can cause future invoices to be left underpaid when 
plan max is met because we do not have the valid OON overpayment to consolidate. (4) May leave 
a balance on the invoice due to full payment not being collected which will need to be written off the 
provider since office didn't collect the full OON insurance payment
