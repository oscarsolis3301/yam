## Description

need to work for the credits so check for both HMO credit calc as well as reimbursement calc unable to find the copay and allowed amount in both doc/fee finder. Hence moved to ICS to verify the copay and allowed amount of D8080, D8670 and D8680 and records, there is no available WQ so created a trace ticket
