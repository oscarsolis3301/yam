Hi Christina,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1988338.



Please reference this attached SRG as a guide and follow all steps on creating a WC Guarantor account . Once WC account is created and all needed information is provided, treatment is charged out, an invoice will generate via the overnight process within 2-3 days. If any additional info is needed due to errors, a claim edit biller will request the info and leave a note in the comment for office to view the request. Once errors are clear, invoice will be sent out with all required info and attachments. No help ticket will be needed, Thank you! 

Kindly,
