## Description

However ticket was already created under INC-#1899067 and received response in call notes dated 6/17/2025 stating "he does not know why paid so much (only 4/25 listed) so he sent claim back for review. Will take 7-10 business days and if Metlife made over payment they will issue us an overpayment letter". Checked in clinical docs and the overpayment letter is yet to be received. Hence creating trace ticket.
