Hi April,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1987718.



We are unable to cancel appointments, move appointments, or change templates after the End of Day Process has run (3 days post appointment/schedule day). If you believe this has created an issue with provider pay you will need to contact payroll to have this issue resolved. To change the status of an appointment after the EOD Process has completed please utilize the "Edit Appointment Statistics" Activity on the patient's Appointment Desk.  (See screenshots below.)  Also, please see the SRGs "Managing Provider Schedules" and "Ensuring Provider Pay Accuracy" on the Front Office Learning Home Dashboard for more information.  If you have any further issues regarding this ticket, please let me know.  






Regards, 

Greg MEpic Support
