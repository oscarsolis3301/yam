Thank you for your help! We did our best with manual coordination. The patient just wanted us to follow up and just let me know what fee schedule to use and when its in epic!

Hi Emma,

I just go a response back from my Manager, and we're good to add your office into the region. Please see attached fee schedule for manual coordination. 
I'm going to hope it's working tomorrow. I will keep you updated. :)

Thank you so much for checking on that! I also have 2 more patients coming in tomorrow with that same fee schedule. Is it something that can get resolved today? Or should we wait to see these patients?




Thank you!

Hi Emma,Thank you for reaching out to Patient Benefits.
I'm going to send your ticket to Eligibility for plan verification.
Currently, we do not have Delta Legion fees for your office. 
I will double check everything on our end too because I do see, per the credentialing grid, that your office has started to become in network this month.

Thank you,
