Hi Umesh,


On review FA#843421241 found plan Self-Insured Dental Services PPO / UCR attached as primary coverage for the DOS 06/23/2025 code D4910 was populating correctly. Verified EOB found the code D4910 was allowed less than the expected amount without any specific reason. Upon reviewing the allowed amount matching with Care Series PPO/POS for the code D4910. Checked in CG billing provider is active with CAREINGTON. Hence routing this ticket to eligibility team for plan &amp; Benefit  verification.
