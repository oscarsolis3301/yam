Hi Piruntha,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1984840.



On review FA#855773809 Found plan Freedom Life Insurance Company PPO - Dental / Dental Benefit Providers PPO attached as primary coverage and verified DE form found same plan is attached. Verified  EOB found D1110 has debit,  and fees not matching with fee schedule and with FA. So please verify the Plan attached. Hence routing to eligibility for plan verification. Once verification is completed please route back to ROC FEES to further Review. thank you
