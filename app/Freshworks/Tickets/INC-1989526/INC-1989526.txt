## Description

Ins paid $58.00 for D9310 for dos 10/1/2024 which was absorbed already and $1700.00 from banding 11/24 till 7/25. Ins overpaid and outstanding credit is $758.00. Need to work on credits but no ortho codes found in available fee schedule "Anthem PPO100-300 GP and SP 1254 ID 2016". Need to check with ICS for the allowed amount for banding D8070,D8670,D8680 and records. Claim was previously moved to ICS inquiry but no response received yet also now claim not in ICS inquiry since the payments got distributed by background. No active wq so raised ICS trace ticket and deferred the undistributed and credit wq for 14 days.Â
