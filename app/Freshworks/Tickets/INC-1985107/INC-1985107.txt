**Item Category:** DTX - Epic Error

## Description

IT Refresh happened overnight and now we cant use the Explore Payment Options button in Epic due to the link opening up a blank Internet Explorer window instead of Chrome.&nbsp;Service Desk changed default browser to Chrome but its still doing the same thing. FMP and Dental Eligibility are affected the most. For sure d0798-FO1, d0798-FO2 and d0798-FO3. Would like the OP rooms checked as well&nbsp;
