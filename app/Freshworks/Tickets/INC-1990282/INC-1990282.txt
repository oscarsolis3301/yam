## Description

Hello, reaching out because we had a patient call and inquire about a refund in the amount of $94.40 that was processed back to the card she paid with yesterday. It's been over a year since that transaction took place and that card is no longer active. I am needing that refund back to the card stopped and the refund issued via check to the address on file in guarantor docs. Thank you in advance for your help. Ashlyn

Hi wiederholta,

Unfortunately, we cannot reverse a CC refund once it has been processed. If CC was inactive at time of refund we would've received and error message and been forced to refund via check. Patient will need to reach out to the bank and reference the transaction ID on the refund receipt.Â
