Hi Shan,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1984744.



On review found fees populating correctly for code D2740 Upgrade procedure charge in FA#849778420. In estimate patient has primary coverage Liberty Dental Plan PPO / Dentemax PPO fees link attached Dental Network of America - Dentemax PPO. Verified dental eligibility found LIBERTY DENTAL PLAN PPO [641], DENTEMAX PPO with status ROC Request Pending. When we review the Epic EOB claim processed based on the Guardian PPO DentalGuard Preferred 2020 old fees schedule. As per credentialing grid billing provider status is active with Guardian and Dentemax PPO. Liberty PPO not found in grid. Hence routed to eligibility to re-verify the eligibility and attach the correct plan to patient coverage &amp; FA. After plan reverification if the plan is DentalGuard Preferred need to rebill the claim to get the correct payment as per updated 2025 fees schedule. Please let me know for any additional questions. Thank you
