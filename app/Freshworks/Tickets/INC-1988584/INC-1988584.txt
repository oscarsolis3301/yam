To whom it may concern, 




We received this internal correspondence from our team:




Dear Colleagues,




To continue providing you with a seamless and secure Single Sign-On (SSO) experience, PDS Health is transitioning from the existing Pacific Dental Services Okta tenant to a new PDS Health Okta tenant.


You will continue to use the same authentication methods — Okta Verify or text messages.



Failure to complete the enrollment by the end of week may result in the inability to access Epic going forward.

 Verify - How To Add New Domain 1.mp4


Action Required:


Please register in the NEW OKTA tenant (https://pdshealth.okta.com)
 and enroll in Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to ensure uninterrupted access. For detailed instructions on how to set up Okta Verify and complete your registration, please refer to the provided guide.

Step 1: Visit https://pdshealth.okta.com (This
 is what is changing)


Step 2: Login with your OKTA/EPIC Credentials 


Step 3: Proceed with opening your OKTA Verify App on your Mobile Device and CLICK +


Step 4: Scan the QR Code


Step 5: Add your mobile number and your secondary (backup) email 


Step 6: Verify your account with your SMS code 


However, Brad Calloway (on this email) is having issues getting into his initial access. When available, can you please assist him in getting into his EPIC account so that he can update his OKTA access to the new platform? 

Thank you, 

Amanda
