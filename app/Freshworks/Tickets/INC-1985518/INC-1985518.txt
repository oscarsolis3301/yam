Hi Jorge,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1985518.

On review FA# 874364551 for DOS 07/30/2025 plan Aetna HMO - Dental / Plan L attached as Primary coverage and fees are populating correctly in FA. Verified Dental Eligibility found AETNA HMO [200], PLAN L with status Action required per ROC and ROC Response:PATIENT ELIGIBLE, BUT NOT ASSIGNED TO THIS OFFICE. Verified Credentialing status OD is INN with Aetna HHMO. Hence routing to Eligibility for plan re-verification. 

Thank you
