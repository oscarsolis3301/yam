## Description

Hello,
Patient Carla D. Oliveira (GUAR ID: 12917115) is appearing in my unsecured workqueue. I submitted a SmartPay change request to secure the insurance portion. Her total secured amount should be $867.95, based on 3 monthly payments of $289.32, starting 07/31/25.
However, my workqueue is currently showing her as unsecured for $334 and secured for $533.95.
Could someone please assist in resolving this discrepancy? I’ve attached the PDF file of the SmartPay change request for reference.
Thank you!
