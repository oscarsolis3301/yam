## Description

checked the credit calc using the same ticket response but there is no copay available for D8680, D0470, D0350, D0340, D0340 in ticket response instead of copay they stated the D8680 covered at 50% and no allowed amount available as the claim is not processed yet, D9450 is not a covered benefit under the patient's plan, D0470 covered at 100%,D0350 covered at 50%, D0340 covered at 50%, D0330 covered at 100% and no payments issued for these codes as these cannot be done on the same day as banding . checked in fee finder and document finder for allowed amount document to calculate the percentages there is no document found. Hence need to know about the actual copay or allowed amount to calculate percentage for D8680, D0470, D0350, D0340, D0340 to perform credit calc . Hence creating Â again a trace help ticket
