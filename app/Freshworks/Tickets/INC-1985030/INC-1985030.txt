## Description

Per review, we received $200.00 for banding and no payments received after that, checked Ins Reimbursement using Fee Schedule (DeltaCare CA Ortho 2019 Min Guars), found Ins reimbursement amount $750.00. Ins paid $200.00 for banding. As no more payments received need to know, how Ins is paying for each month, and need to know whether they will pay the reimbursement or not. As there is no active WQ available to move to ICS, Hence created Trace Ticket.
