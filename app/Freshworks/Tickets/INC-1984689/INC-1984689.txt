On review found fees populating correctly for codes D1110, D0274, D0230, D0220 in FA#853601336. Patient has primary coverage Renaissance Dental PPO / Diversified PPO same fees link attached. Verified dental eligibility found RENAISSANCE DENTAL PPO [765], DIVERSIFIED PPO with status ROC Request Pending. When we review the EOB For code D1110 claim not processed based on the Diversified PPO fees. For code D0220 found reason code 94 Processed in Excess of charges. &amp; 97 The benefit for this service is included in the payment/allowance for another service/procedure that has already been adjudicated. Codes D0274 &amp; D0230 denied with reason code 97 and Remark code N22 This procedure code was added/changed because it more accurately describes the services rendered. As per On Base EOB coered code D0350. Per OB Network Careington.  As per credentialing grid billing provider status is INN. Hence routed to eligibility to re-verify the eligibility and attach the correct plan to patient coverage &amp; FA. Please let me know for any additional questions. Thank you
