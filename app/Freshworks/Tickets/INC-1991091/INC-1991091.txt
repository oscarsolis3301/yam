## Description

Delta Dental sent us a letter and we received one from the patient as well regarding an overpayment for services that were deemed not medically necessary. Please see attached request from Delta Dental. I have already issued the full refund to the patient for the services per the request but they are also requesting additional documentation to close the grievance. Please let me know if there is anything on our end that we need to do to get this resolved. ThankÂ  you.
