Hi Gajalakshmi,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1986902.

On review found fees populating correctly for code D3320 in FA#864828294. In estimate based on SP fee type fees populating correctly, However when verifying Delta Dental of GA and FL PPO - Dental / Delta Preferred Epic EOB insurance allowed payment based on GP fee type. In registration found that treatment provided was based on Endo and confirmed the Billing Provider is registered as Endo dentist and provider status is active for DOS, Hence need re-verification with the treatment provided and rebill if required, So that office can receive proper payment for the claim and reprocess with updated fee schedule, Hence resolving the ticket, Please let me know for any additional questions. Thank you
