I connected to the pc and it shows this error when they try to calibrate the primescan it error out and doesn't finish the calibration. It shows this error:I ran the DRPrimescan and it was able to complete the test:I verified that the pc has plenty of free space:I confirmed that the pc was rebooted.&nbsp;I had her try the calibration again and it still failed.
