## Description

DOS 7/16/2025, PT was approved for $4900 through SGF and their NP exam. A portion of this was distributed to UCR of NP exam. NP codes were charged at and should have a $0 charge as a part of the new patient Special as a cash patient that day. Please undistributed that visit and apply towards the unsecured balance. The PT should not have any balance due and the 7/16 DOS should have no charges associated with it as it was a NP special. 

Thanks!

Hi Michael,

I have undistributed the account but we are not able to re-distribute. That would need to be done on office end.Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1985563.
