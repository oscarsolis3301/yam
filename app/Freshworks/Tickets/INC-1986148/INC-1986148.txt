Thanks

 We have verified a temp fee outage. Fees are
being fixed. In the interim, office should utilize fee finder to manually
coordinate pt fees for upcoming appointments.
 
I

On review FA# 874730703 for plan Blue Cross Blue Shield of IL PPO / Dnoa PPO attached as Primary coverage and fees link not attached showing only dashes. Verified EPIC Plan Reimbursement Page found fees contract for plan Dnoa PPO termed on 07/23/2025 and not yet started for DOS 07/30/2025. So please manually override with the FS available in Fee finder. Hence routing to Jocelyn Scott for further review
