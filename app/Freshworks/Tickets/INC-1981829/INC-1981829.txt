Hi Veronica,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1981829.
 
Shirley's account is enabled and her password has been reset. Please note that when a password is reset, it is reset for Windows/OKTA and e-mail, will be applicable for all 3 logins, and will expire every 90 days.

To set a new password, please have them go to https://pacificdental.okta.com and log in with the following credentials:


Username: dhillonsh
Password: r%GT!*8yVu92

They will be prompted to create a new password that must be at least 12 characters long, have at least one capital letter, have at least one number, and at least one special character (!@#$% etc).

After a password change, please allow up to 10 minutes for the new password to sync with Epic after the change has made, before trying to login to Epic again.

Thank you.
