Hi malena.capellan,

We actually don't support Bluetooth connections to the phones, I'm sorry :-(  I think the decision was made for quality of calls and security reasons, so as far as I know we don't have that enabled on the phones.Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1986251.
