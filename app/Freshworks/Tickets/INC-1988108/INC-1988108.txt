## Description

I spoke to a rep, name and ref on current form. When speaking to the rep, everything is covered at 100% up to the $3000 max. However, when ROC verifies eligibility and percentages are at 0% with insurance and everything is pushed to the patient. I want to understand the what the disconnect is? Below is noted from ROC. Again when I call rep states everything is covered at 100%. This is the fourth form I came across that reflected this way.

Hi Jazmine,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1988108.

Good morning. 

"EMP" means Employer. For all dual plans like these, you would go based off "PPO-Employer Fee Schedule=PT Copay".

For further questions please feel free to contact us.

What does EMP stand for?

Hi Jazmine,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1988108.

I hope you're doing well.
I can clarify what the team verified on the DE form. The DE form is filled out correctly. This plan is not a true 100% plan this is a DUAL PLAN, meaning in the insurance portion "0%" is marked and "100%" is marked in the patient portion. 
The plan is based off a "PPO - EMP FEES = PT COPAY" type of plan as mentioned in the comments. 

Please let me know if you have any other questions.

Kindly,

When I talk to a rep, it is the complete opposite of what is in the DE form that you have "corrected" Im asking for clarification..

Tyler... none of my questions were answered. What is the disconnect here?

Hi Jazmine Luna

Thank you for reaching out to Patient Benefits. 
We have updated the dental eligibility form to reflect the most current benefit information. 
Please note, if you notice the coverage does not appear to be attached in the registration, please take the following steps to attach the coverage: 



 Open the Coverage Wizard, by using the “Add Coverage” link located in the top right-hand corner of the Guarantors &amp; Coverages section in the registration view. 
Once in the Coverage Wizard, there will be Coverages located under the search bar. 
Select the coverage that needs to be attached. 
To complete the process, click on the “Finish” button at the bottom left of the screen. 
It is also important to ensure the coverage is attached to the “Visit Info”
