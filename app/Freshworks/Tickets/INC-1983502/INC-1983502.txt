## Description

Hello team,
Please refer to the patient guarantor account that patient made payment on 7/11/25 in order to remain in good standing with the office.

Therefore, please recall patient from TekCollect and do not outsource until status of appeal has been resolved (at least 30 days).
Thank you
Katrina
