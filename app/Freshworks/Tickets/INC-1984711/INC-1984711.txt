On review FA#851682382 Found plan Unitedhealth Group PPO - Dental / Dental Benefit Providers PPO attached as primary coverage and verified DE form found same plan is attached. Verified EOB found allowed amount is correct as per fee schedule but benefits are not matching as per DE form for code D4910,. So Routing to eligibility for benefit Verification. Thank You
