## Description

I had this patient call and state that she saw she got a $50.00 refund on 7/24/25. She stated that the card the refund was sent to is no longer active. She is wondering if she can get the refund on a different card. I let her know that I will submit a ticket to our team &amp; if the refund was kept with the bank, she would have to contact the bank in regards to the refund. Let us know if we can get the $50 proceed on a different card.

Hi alicia.nicolas,

After reviewing the account all 3 refunds were processed back to CC, 2 to card ending in 1431 and 1 to card ending in 4132. Unfortunately, we cannot reverse a CC refund once it has been processed. If CC was inactive at time of refund we would've received an error message and been forced to refund via check. Patient will need to reach out to the bank and reference the transaction ID on the refund receipts.
