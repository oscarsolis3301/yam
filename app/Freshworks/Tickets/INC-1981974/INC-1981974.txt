## Description

Per EPIC review, for DOS 1/28/2025 D4910 having debit balance. Per Onbase paper EOB found, insurance denied the claim as provider info is mismatch. Per credential grid, provider LOGAN D KING, NPI#1962924407, LIC#8977 is not listed. Per web, patient has OON benefits. Previously many tickets has been created for requesting non-par/effective date but all tickets are closed without non-par/effective date. Hence again creating a ticket to get the non-par/effective date of the provider. Attached EOB for reference.
