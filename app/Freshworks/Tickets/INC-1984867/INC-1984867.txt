## Description

VAs per account review INS expect is $0.00 but DBP was rolled for $0.01 with the description of "unbilled" and INS paid from banding till 07/25 including initial records, Since INS over paid we need to check PPO credit calculator but while checking fee schedule document banding codes are not available therefore created ICS Trace ticket under # to know the allowed amount for D9310, D9450, D0330, D0340, D0470, D8080, D8670, D8680 or correct fee schedule document for out plan ( PRINCIPAL PPO ) once we get response then will work for credits,
