Hi Hassen,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1981757.



On review found fees populating correctly for code D4341 and also found 50.00 Individual deductible in FA#865239921 and EOB. Patient has primary coverage Delta Dental of CO PPO - Dental / Delta Premier same fees link attached. Verified dental eligibility found DELTA DENTAL OF CO PPO [438], DELTA PREMIER with status Verified by Front Office. When we review the Epic EOB for code D4341 claim processed based on the Delta Preferred PPO fees with no specific reason codes. As per credentialing grid billing provider status is active for DOS. Hence routed to eligibility to re-verify the eligibility and attach the correct plan to patient coverage &amp; FA. Please let me know for any additional questions. Thank You
