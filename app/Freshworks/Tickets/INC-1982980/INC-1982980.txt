Hi amy.harding,

There was a temp fee outage during DOS. Fees
have been verified in epic and now populating.

There
is a gap in the reimbursement contract from 07/27/2025 to 07/29/2025 so the
office will need to manually coordinate PT fees for any DOS in this time fame using link below.

For
further questions or concerns, please let us know.

Thank
You.

On review FA#873204933 plan Deltacare HMO - Dental / C73 attached attached as Primary coverage and fees link not attached showing dashes. Verified EPIC Reimbursement Contract Upload page found Fee contract for plan C73 termed on 07/27/2025 reactivated on 07/29/2025, So Office will need to manually override the FA with the FS available in Fee Finder. Still fees not populating in FA. Hence routing to Jocelyn Scott for further review
