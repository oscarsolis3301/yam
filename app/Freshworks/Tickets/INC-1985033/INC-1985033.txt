## Description

Guarantor ID: #800943194,
Treatment length: 18M Unpaid; $1,838.00
 Debanding
status: Not completed





No payment received
from the date of banding. We have received a denial stating "N253 -
Incmpl/Inv attend pvdr primary ID". And so claim was moved to ICS inquiry
to follow up on the denial and we have received response as "Claim denied
as the provider is not credentialled, patient is also have OON but cannot
process this claim since the dr Osama Youn is not credentialed". As per
review in credentialing grid Provider " Dr Osama Youn" Is not found
in the Grid. Hence creating a credentialing ticket to follow up on the provider
status.
