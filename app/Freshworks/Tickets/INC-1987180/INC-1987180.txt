## Description

Ins exp is $0.00 and found Ins DBP was revised as $0.01 for banding 1/29/2025 with the description of """"unbilled"""". Ins paid $2147.33 for banding and no dnl as of now in epic . Need to work on credits but upon checking copay not found for ortho codes in available fee schedules DBP BSCA Core ML Voluntary DHMO SCFG281. It is mentioned as BR ( benefit determination requires submission of additional information: affected area, performed procedure description, and rationale for procedure with appropriate diagnostic documentation.) also verified in document finder there is no copay fee schedule is found for the plan ML DELUXE DHMO SCFG281. Found that previosuly created HT # 1943135 and found that we have received response as allowed amount for banding claim for D8040 is $2673.33 and copay is D8040 is $1000.00 and rep stated that this will be the one lumpsome payment and no further payment will be made as the allowed amount has been paid by ins and copay so no further periodic claim payment will be made. As it is a HMO plan there is no ltm, one lumpsome payment. As there is no proper copay amounts for the records and de band code Need to check with ICS for the copay document to get the banding code D8670,D8680 and records. No active wq so raised ICS trace ticket
