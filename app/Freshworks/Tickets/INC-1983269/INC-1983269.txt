Please audit account for the following:

Did the office receive payment from insurance for any Ortho services since 6/3/2022?
Where did the rest of the patient payments go? From what we can see, patient set up an Ortho smartpay, with initial payment of $1000 and 12 month term for $166.67 totaling $3000 out of pocket, however, her current SP undistributed credit is $1996.35.
