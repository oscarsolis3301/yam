Hi Shan,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1987252.

On review FA #846510710 found plan Cigna PPO - Dental / Cigna Dental PPO attached as primary coverage. Verified DE form found CIGNA PPO [399], CIGNA DENTAL PPO with status Completed - ROC. On review EOB found for codes D9223, D2222 allowed amount is correct but DE form benefits are not matching with epic EOB. In DE form found 80% Ins. resp &amp; 20% Pat. resp. As per credentialing grid billing provider status active for DOS. Hence routing to eligibility for benefit re-verification. 


Thank you!
