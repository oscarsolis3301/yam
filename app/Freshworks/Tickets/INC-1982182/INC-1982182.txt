Hi Josvin,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1982182.

On review FA#834658452 found plan Southwest Service Administrators - Dental / UCR attached as Primary coverage and found for code D4910 UCR Plan for Miscellaneous-UCR carrier fees link attached. In fees system Southwest Service Administrators - Dental / UCR plan not found but it's comes under Miscellaneous  UCR plan. Verified DE form found   SOUTHWEST SERVICE ADMINISTRATORS [1196], UCR [30000882] is attached . Verified EOB insurance allowed and paid less amount than the FA without any specific reason for code D4910 . Payer has different UCR than PDS &amp; office needs to manually coordinate with carrier to sort carrier payment, Hence resolving this ticket, Please let me know for any additional questions, Thank you
