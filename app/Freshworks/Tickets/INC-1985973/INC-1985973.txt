Hi jocelynn.baron,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1985973.



Access for 116 is there.However, for 1168 unfortunately our department cannot add any provider to Epic until an Add Provider Request form is submitted for review.The form is located here: https://www.pdsconnect2.com/forms/add-new-provider-form/ , and it must be filled out and completely submitted in order for a provider to be set up in Epic in a new location. This form is the only way to let all departments that are involved in setting up a provider know that a new location setup is needed.Once it is confirmed by the Legal department that both the hiring process and contract are completed, IT will be able to start the process of granting access to this new location.IT will process the request as quickly as possible. If you have already filled the form, please contact teammemberprocessing@pacden.com for further assistance.
