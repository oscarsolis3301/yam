Hi Ashley,

The OD at the office will need to take over the encounters and close them on behalf of the providers no longer at the practice. If there is no OD at this office at that point typically the AD will then close the encounters on the providers behalf. You can also reach out to your RM for guidance on who will need to close the encounters if there is no OD at the practice.Â Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1986029.
