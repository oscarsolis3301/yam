Hi edwardsmcdougalj,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1984316.



On review found only one FA ,  Void FA# 873072133 for DOS 07/29/2025 &amp; 07/30/2025 plan Deltacare HMO - Dental / C73 attached as Primary coverage and fees link not attached and fees are showing dashes. Verified Dental Eligibility found same plan is attached. Verified EPIC Reimbursement Contract Upload Page found that fee contract for plan Deltacare HMO - Dental / C73 is active from 07/29/2025. So please replace the FA or recreate the FA to get the correct fees. Hence resolving this Ticket. Thank You
