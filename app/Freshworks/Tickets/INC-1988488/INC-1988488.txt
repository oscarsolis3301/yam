## Description

The office received the attached refund request from Principal's Legal Council looking for a refund that was requested in November 2024.  The previous request was never handled by the prior office manager. I need to get this refunded to Principal immediately to prevent any further legal action coming towards the office.  The provider is no longer at the office as well.
