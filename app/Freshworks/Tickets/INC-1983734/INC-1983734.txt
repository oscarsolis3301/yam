## Description

Hi, 
I am not sure if this is right place, just needing some assistance with this patient. He was wanting to transfer to a different PDS location and the services rendered code was charged out. Patient decided to stay at current location after billing out services rendered, at that time code was removed. Dr. Stacey is fine with contract being reinstated as it previously was, payment plant seems to still be active and current, Payment Plan #: 2874723-001. 

Please let me know if I need to reach out to a different dept, or if I need to do anything on my end.
Thank you!
