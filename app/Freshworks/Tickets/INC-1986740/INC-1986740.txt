Hi Kristen,
    OK, I have sent my request to the bank to make sure it was not deposited via phone app. Once it is confirmed we
can start the process of a new check. I know you said address on file is correct, but there are various places this address
is stored. I go by the address on the Guarantor demographic page.. is this the address that was confirmed?
