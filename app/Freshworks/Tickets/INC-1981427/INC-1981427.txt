Hi Rylee,

Please specify with more details of what is needed here? Per review, I see insurance paid as expected so there is nothing for us to assist with on DOS for the insurance balance is $0. 


If this is for a patient refund then office would need to assist. ROC Audit is not
able to make patient side adjustments or assist with balances or credits as
this is to be completed at the office level. Please reach out to your RM or
front office trainer for assistance if needed.
