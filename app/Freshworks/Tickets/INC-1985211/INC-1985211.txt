Hi brooke.begley,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1985211.


As per request need to bill the insurance because there is no claim on file for DOS 02/12/2025 and 04/03/2025. So checked in epic found there is claim for both DOS 02/12/2025 and 04/03/2025. As per checking both claims were denied for pre auth number. As per checking on referral form no pre auth number were found. So kindly please attach correct referral form with pre auth number then we could rebill ASAP. Thank you.
