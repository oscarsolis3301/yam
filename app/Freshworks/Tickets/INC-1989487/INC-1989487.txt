## Description

Hello, I had a patient come in today as an NP. She has VA Loma Linda insurance, and we have to pre-authorize all of her dental treatment before we can complete. Can you please help submit the forms for pre-authorization? Patient is Jalontae Jones MRN: 26051033. I have attached the VA forms if you can help submit the forms with the doctor and hygiene notes, x-rays and Perio chart. We need a pre-authorization for all of the dental treatment in the patient's chart. Please call me if you need me to do anything further. Nicole Modl - Operations manager - 714-202-0765
The fax number I found on the forms is 909-328-7789 and email was HSRMSupport@va.gov
Thank you
