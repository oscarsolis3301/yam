Hi nidia.vargas,

Thanks for reaching out to us!

We have verified a temp fee outage. Fees are being fixed. In the interim, office should utilize fee finder to manually coordinate pt fees for upcoming appointments.

I will update and resolve your ticket once fees have been verified in Epic. 

Thank you, 

Haley
