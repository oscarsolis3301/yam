## Description




Good afternoon,




Dr. Milgrim, who supports office 213 received a credentialing request for his malpractice insurance. 




He did reach out to Risk yesterday to obtain this information. Historically credentialing will get this information directly from Risk when it's a new associate doctor that has Malpratice insurance through PDS. Can you please assist here so we can avoid any
 delays in credentialing.




Thank you for your help,
