Hi Jacalyn,

Its difficult to keep track of the DEAs that get approved since there are so many request to approve and revoke DEAs, we typically will only reach out if there was an error approving that DEA, is this provider in the office or will they be in the office soon? Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1988455.
