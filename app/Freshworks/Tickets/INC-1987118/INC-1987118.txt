## Description

So by checking fee finder found document (Blue Shield of CA DHMO Plans 2024) but our patient plan "Bsca Family Dental Child Scfg292" is not available. So previously created trace ticket#1971048 to find the respective fee schedule but no response received from ticket and found status was closed. Hence, again created trace ticket# to get the banding year 2023 fee schedule document for Blue Shield of CA HMO / Bsca Family Dental Child Scfg292 or need to know the ortho copay amount for banding, retention, monthlies and records.
