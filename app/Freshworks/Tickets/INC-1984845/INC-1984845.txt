-As per review found insurance banding is on 5/2024, along with 12 months treatment Per review it’s a unbilled case and need to work for the HMO credit calc and Reimbursement calc . Hence, we don’t have any banding payment for the dos , hence only make payment for the code D8660 $250 and also there is no denial is mentioned and no more payments is also made, so we need to know the exact denial reason why the payments is being no paid, hence, routing to the ICS to more follow up as per the  proper response we can work after it.and need to defer the undistributed work ques for 14 days. Hence we don’t have any work que to route to ics , so need to create a trace ticket.
