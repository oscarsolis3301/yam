## Description

Patient was seen 10/24/23 and Dr. Kevin Dionisio charged out full upper and lower dentures and Humana insurance paid 100% of the denture. So I am unable to create a credit on the patient account. Â 30% production transfer needed $222.30 per line item so total of 444.60 needs to be transferred from Dr. Dionisio to Dr. Esquibel.
