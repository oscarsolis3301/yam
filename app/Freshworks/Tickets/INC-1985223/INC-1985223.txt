After looking into this issue and remoting into the computer it seems like the issue is what actual Account you guys are logging into. Citrix/Epic works off of the user that is logged in- Using the Pearland1 generic account is not going to let you use Epic at all. But if you all sign in as yourselves it will work on those Orhto Computers.  I tried calling back  to inform the office of this resolution but did not get an answer at 11:04am Central time
