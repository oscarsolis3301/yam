Hi vasikaran.mari,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1989770.



On review found fees populating correctly for code D3330 in FA#839759021. Benefits updated after record was finalized. Replace to update amounts. Verified EOB insurance allowed as per FA but paid less amount with reason code J24 Benefit maximum has been reached., Verified Dental Eligibility found plan maximum 1,500.00 already met 902.50 as per previous DOS 06/02/2025 payment now current EOB payment 597.50. No call notes found in Summary page so please reach out to insurance for more clarifications, In DE form Plan details no updated. Â Hence routed to Eligibility for plan details re-verification. Please let me know for any additional questions, Thank you
