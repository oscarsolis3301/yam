## Description

As per review found that we have received payment from banding till 11/24 and 03/2025, insurance is non auto payor / Monthly as per all payor records and previous payments, we haven't received the payments for DOS 6/25 and 7/25 but we have visit, for the overpayment we have to perform PPO Credit calc. Outstanding credit is $58.76. Need to perform PPO credit calc but upon checking in fee finder and document finder no fee schedule that contains ortho codes in it. So need allowed amount fee schedule. There's no WQ to route
