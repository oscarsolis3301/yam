Thank you for reaching out to Patient Benefits. 

Upon verifying the patient's benefits, we found the current policy was terminated on [7/26/25]. 

For assistance with re-verification, please review and update the patient’s dental policy.

Did name &amp; DOB search for the subscriber as well, we found no other active plan. And as per rep, the fee schedule followed was DELTA PPO for the terminated plan.
