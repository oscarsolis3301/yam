Hi Kishorekumar,

Thank you for reaching out to Patient Benefits.
Per EOB, N130    N130-CONSULT PLAN BENEFIT DOCUMENTS FOR INFORMATION ABOUT RESTRICTIONS FOR THIS SERVICE.
Also, this is a UCR plan and the fees team is not privy to what the insurance pays for specific codes, they could have their own fee schedule.
Please manually override per EOB. 

Thank you,
