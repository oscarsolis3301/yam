Hi Arrianna,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1985329.

Based on the ticket notes it sounds like one of your sensor boxes may be physically damaged. For warranty replacements we need to reach out to Patterson Technology Center and work with them as they handle all RMA issues with Sirona. We can setup a conference call or you can reach out directly to PTC at 800-475-5036. Please note that there is a current backorder on sensor boxes and per the latest information from PTC they will be back in stock around mid September.


Thank You,
