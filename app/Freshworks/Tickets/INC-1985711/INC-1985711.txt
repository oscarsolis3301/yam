## Description

Hello,
We are seeing two patients today that have Anthem HMO insurance and the DE says our provider is not credentialed and i know that we previously have been. I am trying to figure out if this information is accurate, if so, why are we not credentialed and how do we get that credentialing back?
Thank you for your help.
