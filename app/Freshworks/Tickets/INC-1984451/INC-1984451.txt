## Description

Hi - I spoke with Ivorii @ UMR; REF# 250729-00093663. Per rep, initial claim was denied due to age limit (hidden limitation, ortho covered ages 8-18, pt was 7 yo during banding date.) Ivorii stated now that Grayson is 8, ORTHO should be covered, and we can send claim in for reprocessing. If we can please send a corrected claim to UMR. Also, initial claim was submitted using incorrect code D8030 - please submit for D8080, and send claim to Cigna also (secondary insurance.) Thank you so much!
