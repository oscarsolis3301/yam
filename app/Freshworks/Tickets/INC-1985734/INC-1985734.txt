## Description

I called sunlife 800-442-7742 and talked to Emily reg dos 11/27/24. She said the claim was rejected since 2740 is only covered with fracture or extensive decay so 2950 doesn't qualify for pt either. We can appeal and send in a narrative and pre op xray for evidence by fax 623-760-1876 or mail to POB 311 Millwaukee, WI 53201. Claim #202513432788600 and ref#202500518497. Â I talked to Dr Tran and he has done a good narrative, please send out with this information.
