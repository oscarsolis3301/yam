Can you please let us know the status of insurance pending on this account.  Narrative is in the addendum as well as listed below:  REP STATED there was information sent via NEA but no appeal found.     o Whom It May Concern,  We are submitting this formal appeal on behalf of our patient, Mae'shaa Murdock,, regarding the denial of claim #EX37GDH2900. The claim was initially submitted using procedure code D6106, which was incorrect. D6106 refers to a guided tissue regeneration membrane placed at the time of implant placement, which does not apply to this case, as no implant was involved.

In order to preserve ridge architecture and support future prosthetic treatment, a bone graft (D7953) was placed at the time of extraction requiring D7956 Membrane to be placed at the same time.
