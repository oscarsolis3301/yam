## Description

RI requested information with RI TAG is in the addendum - Spoke with insurance REP on 7.30.2025.  No appeal is pending and appeal form must be submitted.

Can you please let us know the status of insurance pending on this account.  Narrative is in the addendum as well as listed below:  REP STATED there was information sent via NEA but no appeal found.

o Whom It May Concern,
We are submitting this formal appeal on behalf of our patient, Mae'shaa Murdock,, regarding the denial of claim #EX37GDH2900. The claim was initially submitted using procedure code D6106, which was incorrect. D6106 refers to a guided tissue regeneration membrane placed at the time of implant placement, which does not apply to this case, as no implant was involved. The correct procedure code is D7956, which accurately reflects a membrane placement performed at the time of extraction of tooth #8.
Tooth #8 was extracted on 10/15/2024 due to a non-restorable fracture. In order to preserve ridge architecture and support future prosthetic treatment, a bone graft (D7953) was placed at the time of extraction requiring D7956 Membrane to be placed at the same time. Following appropriate healing, the patient returned for definitive prosthetic treatment on 02/04/2024. A 3-unit fixed partial denture (bridge) was placed with abutments on teeth #7 and #9 (D6740) and a pontic replacing missing tooth #8 (D6245).
The patient has no other missing teeth in the arch, so an alternate benefit for a removable partial denture should not apply. This is the initial placement of a bridge, not a replacement of a prior prosthesis. The clinical notes, radiographs, and extraction documentation confirm this treatment plan was appropriate and medically necessary to restore function and aesthetics and prevent further shifting or supraeruption.
We respectfully request reprocessing of the claim using the corrected procedure codes:
    D6740 for retainer crowns on teeth #7 and #9
    D6245 for pontic on tooth #8
    D7953 for the bone graft placed on 10/15/2024 at the extraction site
    D7956 for membrane #8 placed on 10/15/2024
Supporting documentation, including chart notes, radiographs, and the original denial, is enclosed. Please contact us if further information is needed. We appreciate your reconsideration and prompt attention to this matter.
