Hello Team,
My correction has been completed and is now awaiting approval. This office is an exception.

This is the message received from our "IT Dept" is shown below:

"Hello office 517 has a exception where all adjustments stop for approval in the office. This was put in place about 4 to 5 years ago. As requested from Dr. Spooner to David Swanson"

Hope this helps,
Respectfully.
