Hi Chinnamani,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1987016.



On review found fees populating correctly for code D2392 in FA#865850095. Patient has primary coverage United Concordia / Advantage Plus fees link attached UNITED CONCORDIA - ADVANTAGE PLUS - Advantage Plus TX1 Reg 60. Verified dental eligibility found UNITED CONCORDIA [1211], ADVANTAGE PLUS with status Verified by Front Office. As per credentialing grid billing provider status is active for DOS. When we review the EOB claim not processed based on the  Advantage Plus PPO fees. Hence routed to eligibility to re-verify the eligibility and attach the correct plan to patient coverage &amp; FA. Please let me know for any additional questions. Thank You
