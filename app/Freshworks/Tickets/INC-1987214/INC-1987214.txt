## Description

As per review, we received payment for banding only. Outstanding credit is $799.99. Need to perform HMO credit calc but upon checking in fee finder no fee schedule that contains ortho codes in it. So need Copay fee schedule. There's no WQ to route, So as per update previous user created a trace ticket #1951271 we have received a response as called Aetna spoke to rep Ren and he stated that total amount allowable is $3200 patient copay is $2400 Aetna paid $800 towards ortho tx. He stated all other ortho codes are inclusive w/total allowable fee, but the response is not clear, it is doesn't know for which code it belongs too, So we need the copay amount for the following codes D9310, D9450, D0330, D0340, D0350, D0470, D8090, D8670, D8680.
