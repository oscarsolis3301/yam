Hi JoDale,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1988546.


The LWS record that allows your computer to print from within Epic has been requested.

It usually takes a couple days for it to be created, then I'll send an email when it's been setup for you to print - Thank you !

Thanks,
