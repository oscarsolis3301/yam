Hi Hannah,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1984034.



On review FA# 873737058 for  plan Blue Cross Blue Shield of ILPPO / Dnoa PPO attached as Primary coverage and fees link not attached showing only dashes. Verified EPIC Plan Reimbursement Page found fees contract for plan Dnoa PPO termed on 07/23/2025 and not yet started for DOS 07/30/2025. So please manually override with the FS available in Fee finder. Hence Routing to Nicole Oliveri For Further Review. Thank You
