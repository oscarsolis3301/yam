Thank you for reaching out to Patient Benefits. Unfortunately, we are unable to complete your
request.
• Upon review, the patient does not have coverage in the Dental Eligibility.
• Our reps are unable to create coverage.
Next Steps:
• The office needs to go into the dental eligibility tab
• Add the necessary coverage for our Eligibility team to complete the verification process.
