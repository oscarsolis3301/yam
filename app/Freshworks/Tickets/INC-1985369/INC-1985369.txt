Hi Amaya,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1985369.

On review FA# 867911645 found code D8703 &amp; D8704 populate as Non covered with $53.1 as Prof. Discount. Verified Guarantor Account found Guarantor payment of $477.9 posted for each of the D8703 &amp; D8704 codes. Hence routing to Patient Payments team to re-verify the Production.Â 

Thank you
