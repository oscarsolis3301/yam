On review FA# 872675681 plan Delta Dental of GA and FL PPO - Dental / Delta Preferred attached as Primnary coverage and fees are populating correctly and some codes are manually overridden in FA. Verified Dental Eligibility found DELTA DENTAL OF GA AND FL PPO [440], DELTA PREFERRED with status Verified by Auto Eligibility and no Error message is available. Verified Fee Finder fee schedule is already available. Hence resolving this ticket.
