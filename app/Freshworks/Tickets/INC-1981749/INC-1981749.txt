Hi Sneha Thangamani

Thank you for reaching out to Patient Benefits.

Once in the Coverage Wizard, there will be Coverages located under the search bar. 
Select the coverage that needs to be attached. 
To complete the process, click on the “Finish” button at the bottom left of the screen.

Hi Sneha,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1981749.

On review found fees populating correctly for codes D7240, D9223, D9222. For codes D9612, D9985 Fees Overridden. Also found 25.00 Individual deductible for code D7240 in FA#817757757 and EOB. Patient has coverage Guardian PPO - Dental / Dentalguard Preferred same fees link attached. Verified dental eligibility found GUARDIAN PPO [549], DENTALGUARD PREFERRED with status Verified by Front Office. When we review the web portal EOB claim processed based on the Aetna fee schedule. Verified fees system for codes D7240, D9223, D9612 claim processed based on the Aetna 2020 old fee schedule. For codes D9222 &amp; D9985 allowed amount not matched. As per credentialing grid billing provider status is In Network. Hence routed to eligibility to re-verify the eligibility and attach the correct plan to patient coverage &amp; FA. After plan reverification need to rebill the claim to get the correct payment as per the updated Aetna fee schedule. Please let me know for any additional questions. Thank You
