Hi Keilah,Sorry, I also created a UCR [30001390] plan which is approved. If the patient does not go off of Cigna, the office needs to attach UCR and manually coordinate.

Thanks,

Hi Keilah,We have created the new plan and this is populating in Epic. 

Payer: TOTALPLAN CONCEPTS PPO [2126]

Plan: CIGNA DENTAL PPO [30001389]

Claims Address: PO Box 9763, Arnold, Maryland 21012
Phone Number: 877 435 2063

The plan will be dropped to paper and sent to the claims address because the EID is not associated with our clearinghouse. 

Thank you,
