## Description

Good morning,

For my patient Terri Snyder she paid her bill in full to the office for SGF and we placed a refund to her SGF card and it is reflected on 05/08/2025. I have spoken to multiple representatives and so has my patient but she is still getting calls from them about owing money and bills when her account is at $0. Please help me to get this to stop for my Â patient ASAP.

Thank you,

Ashley
