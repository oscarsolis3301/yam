On review FA# 872567366 for Â plan Blue Cross Blue Shield of TX PPO / Dnoa PPO attached as Primary coverage and fees link not attached showing only dashes. Verified EPIC Plan Reimbursement Page found fees contract for plan Dnoa PPO termed on 07/23/2025 and not yet started for DOS 07/28/2025. So please manually override with the FS available in Fee finder. Hence Routing to Nicole Oliveri For Further Review. Thank You
