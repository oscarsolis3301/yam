Hi Aswathy,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1984959.

On review FA#861405801 found plan Operating Engineers Trust Funds PPO - Dental / UCR attached as Primary coverage with Benefits updated after record was finalized. Replace to update amounts. In fees system Operating Engineers Trust Funds PPO - Dental / UCR plan not found but it's comes under Miscellaneous Â UCR plan. Verified DE form found same plan is attached with comments PPO-EMP FEE-PT COPAY. Verified EOB insurance allowed and paid less amount than the FA without any specific reason for code 7953 7210. Payer has different UCR than PDS &amp; office needs to manually coordinate with carrier to sort carrier payment, Hence resolving this ticket, Please let me know for any additional questions, Thank you.
