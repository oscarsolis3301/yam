## Description

Upon checking provider change happened on 12/2024 and found previous call notes stated as payment twice for Dec 2024 &amp; Jan 2025 under old and new provider. We submitted provider change claim from Dec 2024 under new provider ESTHER JANG. rep stated that the payment was made for June 2025, paid amt $57.18, issued on 06/13/2025, via eft# 689587133, Claim# 251349383400. And also cross verified with rep, whether any overpayment letter was sent or not as we requested it on 05/08/2025, as there is two different payment was made under old and new provider. Rep reviewed and said they already sent an overpayment letter to the provider office on the same date - 05/08/2025 under the recovery letter id# 5571. Rep suggested us to refund the money back once the refund letter was received. Upon checking in guarantor docs and OnBase no refund letter was received and checked in chart and clinical docs no letter was received yet. Hence, created trace ticket# to know why the refund letter was not received yet
