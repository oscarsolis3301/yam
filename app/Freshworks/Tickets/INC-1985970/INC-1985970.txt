Hi Eva,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1985970.

Help Ticket was routed to Patient Payments in error as the matter being reported is credit that should be distributed to the visits.

This is beyond our scope and knowledge and it recommended that the office seek assistance from the Front Office Trainer for EPIC related adjustments
