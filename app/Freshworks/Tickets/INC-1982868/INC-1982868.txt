Hi Marina,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1982868.

I've got the ticket open with Proofpoint and asked them to release any of these emails and to whitelist the address. They're usually pretty fast to respond, so I'm hoping to hear something very soon.

Thanks,
Mary

Hi Mary,
 
I forgot to mention, but this is an urgent matter as we need to submit the weekly enrollment to Anthem insurance carrier. It’s important we don’t miss out due to not submitting the providers in an orderly and timely fashion. I really appreciate
 you getting back to me at your earliest convenience.

I have opened a ticket with Proofpoint to see if we're blocking these mails there. I will update you once I hear back from them.
