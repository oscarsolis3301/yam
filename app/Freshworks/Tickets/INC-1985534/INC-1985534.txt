## Description

I have been experiencing 2 problems that seem related. First, my laptop is not charging properly when using an AC laptop charger. The laptop usually charges properly at work when it is plugged into the hp Thunderbolt dock, but with an AC laptop charger (and I have tried several cords), the laptop only charges if I wiggle the cord and push it in very hard. Sometimes, it won't charge even after these steps. 
The second issue is while I am in Teams meetings, I keep getting put on hold. When I go on hold, the sound will drop, I can't hear anything that is being said and the team cannot hear me either. I get a auditory signal and the Teams screen tells me I am on hold and gives an alternate dial-in number. 
Context: I usually turn GlobalProtect on manually and my screen shows that I have pdsi.corp internet access via line (not wi-fi). My USB-c that I plug my work monitors into and the HDMI video port both seem to operate without issues.
