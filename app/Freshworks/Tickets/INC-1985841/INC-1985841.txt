## Description

Hello please rebill DOS and see attached notes.

Called and spoke to Rep: Mitch Ref#254302626
Expressed to rep that there is no COB or Primary coverage because EDS is a discount plan. They do not give us EOBS and there is no where to send claims. Explained to rep we will be resubmitting the claim for payment for endo code D3330. Tried to explain to rep that aetna is the primary coverage. I called and spk to pt and pt called aetna and spk to Rep:Jello Ref#254330352 where rep stated he has updated COB and will resubmit claim. I will also place a ticket for claim to be resubmitted. Filing time has NOT been met//RM
