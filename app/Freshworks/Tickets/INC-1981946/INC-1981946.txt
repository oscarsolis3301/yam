## Description

insurance paid $ 182.00 for records and no banding payment is received as there is no expect . As the insurance overpaid need to check the credit calculator but there is no fee schedule document and also there is no UCR fees to calculate this. Hence previously created trace ticket # 1721852 and received response as Per rep they only two codes are covered D0330 allowed amount $69.00 D9310 allowed amount $152.00". As there is no proper response and no allowed amount to do the credit calculator again raised an ICS trace ticket# requesting an fee schedule document for the insurance.Â
