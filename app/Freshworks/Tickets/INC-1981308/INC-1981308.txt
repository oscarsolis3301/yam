## Description

Pt's outstanding balance of $168.00 paid via outside source Acadiana Cares that was incorrectly sent to collections. A rep contacted the office because the patient was sent to collections for the balance that they paid via check on 05/13/2025. Their records indicate the check was cashed on 05/22/2025. The rep sent over a copy of the invoice a picture of the check and stated that check was cashed by our office. I have attached a copy of the payment receipt to this ticket and scanned into the patient's chart under guarantor docs. Please remove patient from collections upon verification the balance was taken care of. I believe the balance is for DOS 05/12/2025 as the outstanding balance amount matches. 

You can follow up with rep from Acadiana Cares, Maci Richard, at (337) 849-3495 for further verification.
