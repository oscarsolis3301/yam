Hi Kasey,

Fees have been verified in epic and now populating.

There is a gap in the reimbursement contract from 07/27/2025 to 07/29/2025 so the office will need to manaully coordinate PT fees for any DOS in this time fame.

For further questions or concerns, please let us know.

Thank You.

Hi Kasey,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1983402.

On review FA# 873419918 for DOS 07/29/2025 plan Deltacare HMO - Dental / C73 attached as Primary coverage and fees link not attached and codes manually overridden. Verified Fee System plan C73 is already available in Fee System. Verified EPIC Reimbursement Contract Upload Page found that Fee contract for plan C73 termed on 07/27/2025 and restarted on 07/29/2025. Hence routing to Jocelyn Scott for further review. Please manually override the fee schedule and minimum guar available in Fee Finder. 


Thank you
