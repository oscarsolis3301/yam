## Description

The computer in room 13 continually shuts down to a black screen. Once logged EPIC and rads it will stay on for about 30 minutes, but then goes black unless I'm actively using the mouse.

Obviously while working on patients I have x-rays up for reference- then all the sudden it all shuts down.

I just moved to this room today, so honestly not sure when this problem started.

Thanks for help.
