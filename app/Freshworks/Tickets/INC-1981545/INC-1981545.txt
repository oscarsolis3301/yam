## Description

I contacted Liberty Insurance regarding the claim for the date of service 04/07/2025 and spoke with a representative named Gloria. She informed me that the claim was denied because there was no pre-authorization obtained prior to payment. I explained that we have not been required to obtain pre-authorization for similar procedures in the past, and that Liberty has previously covered crowns without one.
Gloria advised that we can file an appeal and provided a list of documents required for submission:
1. A summary of the appeal - include a narrative requesting a one-time exception due to unawareness of the pre-authorization requirement
2. Provider's name and NPI number
3. Claim number: 0062245599
4. Member's ID number
5. Date of service
6. Reason why the denial should be overturned
7. Name and phone number of the appeal contact person
8. Copy of the Explanation of Benefits (EOB)
9. Copy of medical records supporting the treatment (strong narrative, X-rays, etc.)
All documents must be mailed to the following address:
Liberty Dental Plan
