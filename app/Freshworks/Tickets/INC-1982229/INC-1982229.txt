Hi Kalaivani,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1982229.

On review FA# 852002213 for DOS 07/07/2025 plan Aetna HMO - Dental / Plan Li attached as Primary coverage and  showing Benefits updated after record was finalized. Replace to update amounts. Verified EOB, On further review the Plan Li copay pays 40% for D3330 with Aetna Dental PPO SP fee schedule, the copay fee is $778*40% = $311.2. But insurance paid 40% of the Min guar (example: $760*40% = $304). Verified EOB for Code D0220 and found insurance is paid maximum as per the billed amount .Hence resolving this ticket, Please refile the claim to get correct payment and please reach out to insurance for further information. Thank You
