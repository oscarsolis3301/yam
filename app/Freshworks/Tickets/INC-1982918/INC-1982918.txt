## Description

Hello,

Can you please submit appeal for patient, Micah Ranz (DOB 06/21/2003)? In the appeal, please submit addendum narrative and photos made by Dr. Koh. If peer-to-peer call is possible, please request as well. 
Insurance originally denied all three teeth b/c of medical necessity and Dr. Koh wants to try one last attempt to get partial payment from Cigna. 
Thank you.
