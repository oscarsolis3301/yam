Hi Kalaivani Sri

Thank you for reaching out to Patient Benefits.

Once in the Coverage Wizard, there will be Coverages located under the search bar. 
Select the coverage that needs to be attached. 
To complete the process, click on the “Finish” button at the bottom left of the screen.

Hi Kalaivani,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1984757.



On review FA#841214898 Found plan Unitedhealth Group PPO - Dental / Diversified PPO attached as primary coverage and verified DE form found same plan is attached. Verified EOB found for code D0150,D1120,D1351,D1206 allowed amount is Paid less than estimate and fees are not matching with FA and with fee system. Hence routing to eligibility for plan verification. Please route back to ROC FEES for further review. Thank You
