## Description

This ticket was sent by Maintenance:Cerec oven keeps throwing an error code for the vacuum, we have checked the fuses and everything and believe that it is the pump that is not working correctly-we have switched around the clear hose that goes from pimp to oven and then it will work for a day or so-think we need a new pump
