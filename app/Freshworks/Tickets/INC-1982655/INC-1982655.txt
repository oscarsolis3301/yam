## Description


Hi team,
i recently submitted a ticket for credentialing ticket #INC-1956225
the resolution was: 
"Ticket
was raised to get the credentialing information. Upon checking Cg and Delta PDS
Roster, provider is not listed. Checked in Credentialing Stream Dashboard,
provider is pended for credentias,7/02/25: DEA waiver. Contract will be sent to
the payer once the application is ready."

please advise when the application would be ready to be summitted and a timeframe for all of this to take place as we are unable to resubmit the claim until we at least have a non par date for provider.
