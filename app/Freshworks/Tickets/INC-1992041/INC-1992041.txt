## Description

We received payment from banding DOS till 12/24 and records. Upon checking payments found that $470.00 was received twice for 12/23 under different ref#000000040699175 and 000000042523434. So verified in web portal and OnBase but unable to validate the payments. Hence created ICS trace ticket# to validate the payments.Â
