Hi Josvin Wesley

Thank you for reaching out to Patient Benefits. 
We have updated the dental eligibility form to reflect the most current benefit information. 
Please note, if you notice the coverage does not appear to be attached in the registration, please take the following steps to attach the coverage: 



 Open the Coverage Wizard, by using the “Add Coverage” link located in the top right-hand corner of the Guarantors &amp; Coverages section in the registration view. 
Once in the Coverage Wizard, there will be Coverages located under the search bar. 
Select the coverage that needs to be attached. 
To complete the process, click on the “Finish” button at the bottom left of the screen. 
It is also important to ensure the coverage is attached to the “Visit Info”

Kind Regards,

Hi Josvin,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1987170.

On review FA# 849714472 for DOS 07/02/2025 plan Blue Cross Blue Shield of TX PPO / Dentemax PPO attached as primary coverage and fees are populating correctly for codes D7240 &amp; D9223 and Insurance expected and patient pays are manually overridden for code D7240. Verified FA and Dental Eligibility found this patient has Dentemax PPO fees attached however when comparing the EOB the fees are reflecting as per DNOA PPO so showing underpayment. Hence routing to Eligibility re- verify the plan and benefits for the coverage attached. 

Thank you
