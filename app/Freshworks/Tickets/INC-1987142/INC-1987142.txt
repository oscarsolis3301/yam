Hi Rini,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1987142.



This request has been submitted to Provider Relations at Blue Cross ID.  This payer has a multi-step process to gain access to their portal.  Once this TIN has been added to my admin account, we can then create a username for CyberArk. The payer will reach out to me once the TIN has been added. Not all TINs are eligible for logins as this is a regional payer, and we don't credential out-of-state providers. We are resolving this ticket and will continue to follow up with the payer until this is complete.  Please do not open another ticket for this request. Please do not re-open this ticket. Thank you for your patience as we wait for the payer to complete this request.
