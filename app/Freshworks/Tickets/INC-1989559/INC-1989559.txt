Hi Mahalakshmi,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1989559.

On review FA#856656021 found plan Delta Dental of CA PPO - Dental / Delta Preferred attached as primary coverage, Fees populates in FA. Verified DE form found same plan is attached . Verified EOB found Code D3330  allowed amount in EOB is incorrect which is less than FA fees. For code D3330  amount used for calculation is matching with GP fee type with no specific reason code . In registration found that treatment provided was based on Endo and confirmed the Billing Provider is registered as Endo dentist and provider status is active for DOS, Hence resolving this ticket, Please refile the claim to get correct payment and please reach out to insurance for further information. Thank You
