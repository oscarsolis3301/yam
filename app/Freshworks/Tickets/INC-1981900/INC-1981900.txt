## Description

Need to verify calc. Upon review verified in fee finder ortho codes copay not found. Already created fee schedule ticket and so rep stated as this payment is for month of dec 2023 not for banding and banding was denied for TFL as it was rec on 11/7/2024 which is after 1 year as Â TFL IS 1 yr so its denied so its not covered. Therefore without banding allowed amount unable to perform the calc. So again creating ICS trace ticket# to get the fees schedule banding allowable amount not the EOB allowable amount.
