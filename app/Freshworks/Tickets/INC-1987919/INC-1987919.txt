Hi Salena,
This is Sam with the reporting team.  I hope your week is going well.  I see Dr Sandu is available for goal entry into Prism today for office 797.   

Here is my standard reply when offices inquire about Prism goal entry provider lists: 
For access to a new office, the first step is to submit an add provider request.  Next, for a provider to populate for Goals Entry for an office, one of the following conditions must exist:
 
   Provider has a production day in the past 6 months at the office
   Provider has an appt scheduled in the next 90 days
   Provider has an open schedule (template) in the next 90 days
   
Then the criteria will pull that provider in for your office.  If you can please add a template into Epic for that provider, they will populate for goal entry the next day.
