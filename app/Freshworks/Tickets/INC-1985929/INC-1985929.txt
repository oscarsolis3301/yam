Hi Christopher,

I hope you're doing well.

We are unable to transfer Smartpay arrangements between guarantor accounts. Therefore, your office will need to close the current Smartpay arrangement under guarantor ID #10274046 (Chelsea Yocum) and set up a new Orthopay arrangement under her Ortho account, guarantor ID #801059509.Â Additionally, any credits associated with guarantor ID #10274046 will need to be transferred to guarantor ID #801059509.

Thank you, and please let us know if you need further assistance.

Best regards,Stephanie Henry
