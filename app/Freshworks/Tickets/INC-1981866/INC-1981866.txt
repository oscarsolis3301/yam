Hi Kishorekumar,Thank you for reaching out to Patient Benefits.
Per fee schedule, the amount populating on the FA that was correctly overridden and is considered our OS fee. Per the Perio's fee schedule, code D7210 is not covered.
Please see attached Perio fee schedule. Override matches EOB.

Thank you,
