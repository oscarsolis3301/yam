Hi Laura,

See that treatment discontinue code has been charged out as of 07/29/25 please allow time for both ortho revisions (insurance) and patient payments to review as both teams will need to take action prior to services rendered finalization. No further action required at this time.Â Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1984035.
