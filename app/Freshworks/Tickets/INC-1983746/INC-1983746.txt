Hi Robert,

Ok, it sounds like you will need some wiring pulled and a new outlet installed.  That will be a Maintenance ticket.  Unfortunately, I dont think I can open that on your behalf.  Will you be ok to open one for them?Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1983746.

It still functions in its old spot.

Hi Robert,

Ok, good to know, it may be that the outlet at the new spot is not set up for voip.  If you plug the phone back into its old spot and it starts working, that will be the issue, and you would just need to send a ticket to Maintenance to come out and wire up a phone outlet and have that port turned up for voip use.
Let me know what happens when you plug the phone back in to its old spot?Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1983746.

The phone was moved, and it worked before it was moved. We are adding it to the same spot that the info computer is at so its not plug and play like the others.

Hi Robert,
What is the serial number of the phone?  Also is it a new phone or a phone that was working and you moved it?
If you plug the phone that isnt working where a phone is working does it start working?Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1983746.
