Hi,
 
Great question, I’d like some clarification as well. I’ve done it the same way Sherrie.

Hello, 
 
Weve been instructed otherwise. I will reach out to our ROM and ROC rep to confirm what to do moving forward.

 
 
Hello Ari and Tania 
 
Can you please provide some clarity around this ? Are now collecting the full amount or just what the in-network amount and the patient keeps the remainder ?

 
 
Thank you ! 
Sherrie

Hi Kalynn,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1985801.

“MRN# 12521891 INV# A22810411951 DOS 5/19/2025 INS DELTA DENTAL OF CA PPO. Per EOB Insurance paid a total of $164.80 to the subscriber. The office only collected/posted $110.00 on 7/30/2025. Please reach out to the subscriber to collect the remaining $54.80. Not collecting the total OON insurance payment can cause. (1) An inability to give unexpected production to the providers. (2) Allows the patient to keep overpayment that is due to the insurance. (3) Can cause future invoice to be left underpaid when plan max is met because we do not have the valid OON overpayment to consolidate. (4) May leave a balance on the invoice due to full payment not being collected which will need to be written off the provider since office didn't collect the full OON insurance payment.”
