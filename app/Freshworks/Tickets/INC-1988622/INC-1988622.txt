ATT: APRIL KING
 
Good afternoon.  I am following up on a voicemail I left on Wednesday, July 30, and this morning, July 31, 2025.
 
I am prescreening the 855O application on Abdullah Akkad; there is DEA information on the application in Sect. 2.
 
Is the DEA information/number on the application for Dr. Akkad specifically, or is it an institution’s DEA number?
 
Please respond to this email and let me know  about the DEA information on the application.
 
Thank you.
