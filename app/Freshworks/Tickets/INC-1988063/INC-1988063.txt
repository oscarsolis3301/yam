Hi Bianca,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1988063.

On review Dental Eligibility found PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL GROUP PPO [743], DIVERSIFIED PPO with status Completed - ROC and notes : No fees are attached to this plan: Please confirm the correct plan is selected above, attached office is in California but plan Diversified is not applicable for other than Nevada &amp; Utah region. Hence routing the ticket to Eligibility for plan verification. 

Thank you
