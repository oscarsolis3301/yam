Hi Paula,

Per review, OON check was not received by payor to patient. Patient would need to call the insurance as payment was sent to patient to advise check was not received. This request is out of ROC Audit scope. Ticket closed. Thank you!Â Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1986359.
