On review FA #865562021 found plan Guardian PPO - Dental / Dentalguard Preferred attached as primary coverage with alternate benefit provision applied for D2391 tooth #2 and fees are manually Overridden withÂ $50.00 deductible charged. Verified DE form found plan GUARDIAN PPO [549], DENTALGUARD PREFERRED with Verified by Front Office. Verified Epic EOB found for code D2391 allowed amount not matching with FA with deductible. As per review found that the claim has been processed using old fee schedule "Guardian PDS FL 2 GP Eff12152020" fee schedule. Need to resubmit the claim so that office can receive proper payment for the claim and reprocess with updated fee schedule, Plan attachment and fee schedule have been verified to be correct. Insurance is using an old fee schedule. Hence resolving this ticket.

Thank you!
