## Description

the computer in operatory 2 is not working properly. I have placed a ticket about this once and have yet to have this issue address. Pleases help our office figure out the issue so we may use the operatory to service our patients. We are currently experiencing continuous shut off of the computer system. It logins and requires a password that NO one in the office knows and then the system shuts down.Â
