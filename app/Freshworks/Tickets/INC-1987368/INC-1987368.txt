## Description

Hello team,
Please remove this account from collections. Patient paid in full for DOS 4-11-2025 with SGF, however the payment was posted on his wife's account (MRN 14513033 Lynn Henderson DOS 4-15-2025) mistakenly, which was an error from our front office.

He is adding the rest of his balance to his SGF which i will call his wife to set up once we have her consent.

Thank you so much for your help with this. I apologize for you not being able to get ahold of me, i was on the phone with a patient, and we are having a "Call Party" to catch up our collections here in Winterhaven.  If you could please transfer the total credit from Lynn to Dale in the amount of $1,127.64. Thank you again!

Hi Ashley,

I tried calling you a few moments ago with no luck. Can you confirm the credit amount that needs to be transferred from wife Lynn to Dale?

As of right now Dale has a balance of $1,764.60 while Lynn has a credit of $1,127.64 available. If I partially or fully transfer the credit there will be a balance due.Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1987368.



Warm regards,
