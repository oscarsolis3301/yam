Hi Alexandra,

was doing more testing, and did validate in your login that appts accessed from Dr. Sami's column are working correctly. Chula Vista 2 and Dr. Sami auto populate by the system in the Requested activity. Please see attached screenshot.


please double check you were logged into the correct context, and snapboard for 274 is populating. 

If there was an alternate way you were accessing the patient charts, this could be the reason the provider wasn't populating. But if you come across another example, please grab a screen shot and send it my way.

thank you.

I am assisting from another office and need help accessing office 274's providers. I currently am not able to pull any other provider up. I did try through the search bars.

Hi Alexandra,

There are two providers in OS that should pull up: Pavol Porazik, and Joshua Parfitt, if you use the magnifying glass search or use search to pull them up they should appear for you (keep in mind some specialists are listed under a different address other than the treating office). If there is another provider outside of these two that you are looking for, please let us know. Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1986499.
