## Description

As per review claim is in unbilled. Received payment from banding till 07/25 DOS including records &amp; upgrades. Looks Payment was received under Pacific union HMO plan for records and UHC PPO for banding and monthlies. All the payments are received under same member id#. Per coverage tab we have UHC PPO effective before banding. Checked OnBase unable to locate paper EOB and we have deposit in remittance tracker. Checked UHC portal found patient is active from 01/01/2025 DOS which is before banding and unable to verify payment information due to portal showing issue after multiple attempts as "claim search not available at this time". So need to verify the payment information of records and banding whether it was received under PPO plan or HMO plan, already claim o ICS inquiry to verify the information, no response received Yet.
