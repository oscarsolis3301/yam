## Description

As per account review INS paid from banding till 07/25 , while revising DBP unpaid balance was going beyond the TXT length, So checked HMO reimbursement calculator using (Cigna Cap P5I0X 2024 &amp; Cigna SP OR 30502 Eff 120118 ) and it shows that INS responsibility is $1542.96, So we need know why INS is not making the payment with in the TXT length, Already trace ticket was created but irrelevant info received, Therefore again creating ICS Trace ticket to know what is reimbursement amount and why INS expect will not met with in the TXT length, Once we get response from ICS team then will work accordingly, Until defer the available WQ for 14 days,
