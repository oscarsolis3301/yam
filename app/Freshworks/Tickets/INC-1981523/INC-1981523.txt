## Description

Hello! An Addendum has been fixed and created in the treatment plan. Dr. Wright has update his note also to reflect the correct tooth number. We need to make sure that the insurance is aware of the error and that it's corrected. Billing might had put tooth #15 when the actual treatment is #19. Please ensure the change have happened on the billing. Thank you for your help.Â
