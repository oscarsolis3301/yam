Per review, A67310017690 has been voided and A67310019860 has been created for DOS 09/05/2024. Per review CDT D2643(19) received payment $372.00 under check# 111000023258096 and it was voided and the payment has been undistributed. Per review CDT D2643(19) has been voided and reposted. Per EPIC coverage DELTA DENTAL OF CO PPO is primary and DELTA DENTAL OF WA - WDS PPO is secondary.
