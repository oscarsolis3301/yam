Hi brostromsibleyc,

There
was a temp fee outage during DOS. Fees have since been verified in epic and now
populating as of this morning.

There
is a gap in the reimbursement contract from 07/27/2025 to 07/29/2025 so the
office will need to manually coordinate PT fees for any DOS in this time fame using link below.

Hi brostromsibleyc,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1983857.

On review FA#873644799 for the DOS 07/29/2025 plan Deltacare HMO - Dental / C73 attached as primary coverage and fees are showing dashes in FA. Verified DE form found same plan is attached . Verified Epic Reimbursement page  found fees contract termed on 07/27/2025 and not yet started.  So please manually override with the FS attached here. Hence routing to Jocelyn Scott for further review
