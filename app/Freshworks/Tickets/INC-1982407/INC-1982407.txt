Hi Chenelle,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1982407.

As per request need to send corrected claim as Patient did not want dentures for DOS 01/27/2025. So for sending corrected claim we need to void (remove) the codes from the invoice. So kindly please remove the denture from the invoice and let us know so we could send corrected claim ASAP. Thank you.

Regarding MRN#  25353304 Charles Haney


Please review the SRG FO_Correct_Treatment_Charged_Out  Please have the Provider follow the steps and uncomplete any incorrect treatment charged out (if requesting to be removed from patient history) OR If treatment was completed but due to patient unsatisfactory, requesting to be removed from patient history. Corrected Claim may be sent once the provider completes the Addendum Workflow, thank you.
