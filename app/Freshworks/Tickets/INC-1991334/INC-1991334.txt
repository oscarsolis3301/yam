## Description

Hello!
Kaylee's monitors have been connecting and disconnecting at random times throughout the day. The laptop is connected to the docking station correctly, and the cables are secure from the monitor to the docking station. We are unsure of where it is getting disconnected from. Could we get someone to check it out or swap out the docking station or the monitor cables? 
This is for Kaylee Goodwin Seat B70
Thank you!
