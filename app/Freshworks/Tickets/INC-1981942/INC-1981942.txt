Hi Monika,

Per review, cigna termed on 12/31/2024 which is after DOS but coverage not reflecting in coverage tab or DE. Therefore, RI opened to have coverage added so coverage change can be completed. Unable to complete ticket due to no DE for cigna. Thank you!Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1981942.
