## Description

As per review found we received payment from the banding DOS till 07/25 and initial records. Upon checking the payments found that unpaid amount was exceeding the treatment length. So checked reimbursement calc and found that ins will pay up to $2000.00, but we are receiving less payments. Hence created ICS trace ticket# to verify why ins is paying less than the reimbursement amount.Â
