## Description

hello,
I have a claim edit that shows that coverage was inactive for a date of service that the insurance website shows active coverage. I need help adjusting that claim. From the Delta Dental website, they have a record of the claim for the 2 fillings but nothing else. 
Can I get some help processing that claim so it can be submitted please

Hi Kevin,

If DD of PA was active during DOS then please add an active DE form for payor and also update in coverage tab so we can update the coverage to the claim. We cannot complete this request until those two things are completed. Thank you! Ticket closed. Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1986362.
