Hi Brandy,

Good day!  I have scheduled an office visit for 7/29/25 to address this request and see if I can get any other identifiable information from the device.  There should be a serial number on the bottom that should help identify the device.  If you are able to locate this, please feel free to send it to me but otherwise, if you are unable to locate it, I will be by the office later today to see if I can identify the device.

Thank you for your time.  I look forward to communicating with you more later today.

Sincerely,
Mike Dyke
