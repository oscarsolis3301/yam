Hi gopalakrishnanb,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1987312.



Resolution: I called metlife and unable to locate patient or retrieve check info for 7/21-9/21.
I pulled EOBs from UCCI web all 7/21-10/21 are from check #0906598999. Patient termed w/UCCI 10/01/21. I attached all eobs to ticket.
No further action needed from ICS

Thank you,
Angela
