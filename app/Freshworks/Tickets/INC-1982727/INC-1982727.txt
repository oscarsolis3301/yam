I had customer reseat all of the cables and try to turn it on but it still doesn't stay on unless she keeps the power held down. Â 
I had customer unplug the power and discharge the capacitors. I had user reconnect the power adapter and try to turn on the pc again and this time it came up to the HP Sure Start screen but it was hanging. I had her shut it down and restart it again and this time it went to a loading screen.
She said it did boot to Windows this time.
