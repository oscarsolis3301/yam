Hi there,
I found your office through the Lincoln Financial insurance provider search and wanted to check in about pricing. I'm looking to get a double root canal on my upper left and right side premolars and was wondering what the cost might be with Lincoln Financial dental insurance. Myupper left premolar area's cavity fell out and I was told a root canal for both areas was needed asap.
Do you happen to have a ballpark estimate for what I'd pay out-of-pocket? Also, do I need to schedule a consultation first, or get anything pre-approved with insurance?
Thanks so much for your help!
Savannah Seymour
