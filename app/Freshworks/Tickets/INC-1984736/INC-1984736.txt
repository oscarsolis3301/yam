Hi Balasubramani,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1984736.

On review found fees populating correctly for code D2740 Upgrade procedure charge in FA#858742124. Patient has primary coverage Metlife PPO - Dental / Metlife Pdp same fees link attached. Verified dental eligibility found METLIFE PPO [670], METLIFE PDP with status Completed - ROC. When we review the web portal EOB claim processed based on the Ameritas PPO fees. As per credentialing grid billing provider status is Unverified with Metlife and active for DOS with Ameritas. Hence routed to eligibility to re-verify the eligibility and attach the correct plan to patient coverage &amp; FA. After plan reverification route back to fees team because need to route to region specific person to verify the provider status with Metlife. Please let me know for any additional questions. Thank You
