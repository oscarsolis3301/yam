DOS: 06/11/2025
CDT: D0274,D0220,D0230
INS: METLIFE PPOÂ 
Denial reason: Per ERA, denied as SECONDARY PAYMENT CANNOT BE CONSIDERED WITHOUT THE IDENTITY OF OR PAYMENT INFORMATION FROM THE PRIMARY PAYER. THE INFORMATION WAS EITHER NOT REPORTED OR WAS ILLEGIBLE.

Per review claim denied as above. Per initial NEA#373737454, primary EOB was already sent with all other necessary documents. No paper EOB in ONBASE. Unable to get paper EOB as office logins at CyberArk failed due to incorrect login credentials. So creating CyberArk ticket# to reset office logins.
