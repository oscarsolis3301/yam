## Description

As per review found we received payment from the banding DOS till 03/25 and initial records. No need to work on denial PR 119 due to ins overpaid. We have outstanding credit $313.48 and true credit $276.00. Upon checking in fees schedule ortho related codes are not listed. Hence previous user has created ICS trace ticket#1942967 and got response for all the codes expect some codes. There is some codes which was not given by rep on call and so creating ICS trace ticket# to get the respective fees schedule for allowable amount with all the ortho codes were listed.
