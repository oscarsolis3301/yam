Hi Infant,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1984703.



On review found fees populating correctly for code D1110 in FA#864419586. Patient has primary coverage Delta Dental of VA PPO - Dental / Delta Premier same fees link attached. Verified dental eligibility found DELTA DENTAL OF VA PPO [464], DELTA PREMIER with status Completed - ROC. When we review the EOB claim processed based on the Delta Preferred PPO fees. As per credentialing grid billing provider status is active for DOS. Hence routed to eligibility to re-verify the eligibility and attach the correct plan to patient coverage &amp; FA. Please let me know for any additional questions. Thank You
