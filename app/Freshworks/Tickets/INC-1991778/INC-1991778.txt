## Description


Good evening,




It was brought to our attention that Dr. Salbo was opted out of participating with Medicare Dental plans in Georgia.  To increase patient access and revenue for the offices she supports, we would like to get her in network with Humana DEN plans and the Aetna
 Medicare Advantage plans.  With her approval, can we please get this process started?  Please let me know if there is anything else you need from us.  Thank you for your assistance!




Regards,
