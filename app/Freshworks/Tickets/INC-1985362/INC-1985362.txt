## Description

Aetna is requesting FMX or PANO and perio chart for pre-auth (attached file is EOB of authorization received). Since this is an outside referral I received PANO and perio chart from the referring GP. Perio chart is scanned into the chart under "Outside Record, Perio Chart from Distinctive Dentistry" and PANO was uploaded into DTX. Can you please submit this additional information to Aetna?
