Hi Judith,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1985958.


On review FA# 874608999 for DOS 07/31/2025 plan Healthnet HMO / Iex Ifp Sfss136 attached as primary coverage and fees are not populating showing only dashes. Verified Dental Eligibility found HEALTHNET HMO [214], IEX IFP SFSS136 with status Verified by front office. Verified Fee System found plan Iex Ifp Sfss136 available but in EPIC Reimbursement Contract Upload page plan Iex Ifp Sfss136 is not available and unable to push for upload. Hence routing to Jocelyn Scott for further review. 


Thank you
