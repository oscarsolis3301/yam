Hi Kimberly,

In order to have patient charging plans reinstated and charges allowed to post to account, office needs to charge out a treatment restart code on the date of service patient returned to treatment after dismissal date. In addition since treatment length has been met for original treatment length -

If patient will be needing additional treatment, please provide treatment extension narrative in addition to charging out codes as it is needed for billing: 
Narrative needs office official letter head and provider
signature answering the following:
1. How long is extension 
2.why is extension needed 
3. Is patient being charged
