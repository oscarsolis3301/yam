Insurance is Non auto payor / Monthly as per all payor records and previous payments, Need to perform PPO credit calc but upon checking in fee finder and document finder no fee schedule that contains ortho codes in it. So need allowed amount fee schedule, already previous user created fee schedule ticket #1568368  received response as  Verified Box Folder and below attached is the FS for banding year 2023. Hence resolving the ticket and please be informed that Delta Preferred CA, Specialty is based off Delta Premier and is set up by office and all entry for ortho will be based off the SP fee schedule, but it is Delta Dental Premier ‐ Office 255 ‐ Endodontist but we need fee schedule for Ortho. There's no WQ to route
