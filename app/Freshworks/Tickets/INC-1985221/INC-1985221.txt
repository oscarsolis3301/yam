## Description

Hello
I see there is an insurance credit for DOS 12.4.2024 of 1738.66
Bone Graph credit of 478.58,478.56,478.56 and Membrane 101.00,100.98,100.98.  Which is not covered by the dental insurance.  I wanted to be sure we could Estimate correct and give the $ to the provider. 
We are pending adjustments due to Not covered on the dental side and wanted to assure we could give provider $ the same month as we adjust off on the dental side.

I believe these would be ROC Offset Adjustments.

thank you for your help in understanding
