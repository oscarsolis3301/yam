Hi Melissa,Please find your ticket URL: https://support.pacden.com/helpdesk/tickets/1984570.Since the provider is already no longer at the location, hence no need to update the CAQH.

This provider has not been in our office for a couple of years. Here is the message:




Hello,

 

Effective May 2025, all practitioner credentialing will be handled exclusively by our credentialing verification partner,
Certify. To ensure a smooth credentialing process, please make sure your CAQH profile is current and attested within the last 120 days. If you do not have a CAQH account, you can register at
http://www.caqh.org/providers. Be sure to identify Premera as
 a health plan authorized to access your application or select the global authorization option. Certify may contact you for additional information if needed during the credentialing process.

Your recredentialing is due by [06/30/2025]. Failure to recredential by this date will result in termination and member notification.


 

Thank you,

Premera/LifeWise Credentialing | MN
