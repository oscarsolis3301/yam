Dear Dr. Abdelhai,
 
 
Congratulations and thank you for becoming a member of Guardian’s DentalGuard  Network, a leader in the dental industry! 
 Your effective date is 7/29/2025.  
 
As a valued partner, you have agreed to participate in the recredentialing program and continue to adhere to the same criteria
 and professional standards you are currently demonstrating.  Recredentialing will occur every 36 months and you will hear from us in approximately 30 months to begin the recredentialing cycle.
 

Your name and office information will be added to our DentalGuard Network directory at
www.GuardianLife.com. 
 Members are encouraged to visit participating dentists to reduce their out-of-pocket expenses, as many Guardian plan designs provide enhanced benefits with higher maximums, lower co-insurance percentages and waived deductibles when a network dentist is

utilized.

 


Manage benefit administration and obtain your fee schedule online! Visit 
www.GuardianLife.com 
 and use your provider ID (above) to log on.  Click on “Register Now”, choose “Healthcare Professional” and “Agree to the Healthcare Professional Agreement”
 to create your account.  Sign up today!!!


 
If your state has non-Covered Services legislation and you have opted to allow discounts on non-covered services by voluntarily
 accepting the Opt-In Provision, fee schedule amounts will apply to all non-covered services for covered individuals.   This will apply to all office locations at which you participate in our network. 

 
We look forward to enjoying a lasting relationship with you and your dental office.  Guardian values the commitment you have
 made in joining the DentalGuard network; together, we can improve the oral health of members within your community! 

 
Sincerely,
Guardian Dental Network Services
