## Description

Hi team,
Please refer to notes in guarantor account. Multiple attempts have been made to reach patient who remains non responsive. Patient balance is aged over 91 days. Therefore, please escalate balance to outsource. Do not send to TekCollect. Please send directly to collections so that the balance can finally be removed from our unsecured.
Thanks much
Katrina

Please refer to the patient's guarantor account which clearly notes that unsecured aging is 91+ days. Ticket must be re-opened and addressed per OM request.
